She had known before she moved with her husband and daughters that she woukd wake up in the house built by slaves.","commenter_a":"Reading these comments reveals why we're stuck as a nation on racial issues. There are a lot of black people who refuse to acknowledge we're no longer in 1955 and their shortcomings are primarily their own (the Obamas are not in that camp, by the way); and there are a lot of white people in stark denial of our nation's less than glorious past. And do people even read articles before they post their drivel? The First Lady was praising America for our progress, not looking down on the nation. Get a grip, people.","post_message":"Michelle Obama gave her last commencement speech as first lady at the City College of New York."},{"comment_id":"10154108644646178","commenter_b":"This is where GWB, Dickhead Cheney and all those racist MURDERER Cops belongs.

Few today would believe the pseudo-science mumbo jumbo presented as fact to Congress. 1) Smoking marijuana will make black men want to rape white girls. That's girls not women. There is ZERO evidence here. 2) Smoking marijuana will make young men more likely to experiment with homosexuality. THAT may be true, but the rest of the presentation turned that simple statement into more of an assertion that it would turn young men gay.","post_message":"\"It is time for us to replace the failed prohibition with a regulatory system that works and let states and municipalities decide for themselves if they want, or don't want, to have legal marijuana within their borders.\""},{"comment_id":"10154542525666051","commenter_b":"So we get rid of all the illegals and we pay $5.00 for a head of lettuce cause who is going to do all this work?","commenter_a":"Sneaking into our country is explicitly illegal.
