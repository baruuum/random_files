Women who do drugs while they are pregnant can cause problems for these children their entire lives. And we foot the bill for it. They should be charged, never given their kids back and the law should stop having these double standards. And if they didn't cause their kids damage then they still did the equivalent of putting a gun to its head and playing Russian roulette, which would also be child endangerment and child abuse.","commenter_a":"Does anybody find it ironic that they can be charged for exposing their unborn babies to drugs while it is legal for them to kill/abort those same babies? Either unborn babies are people with rights or they aren't. Odd how \"the law\" can have it both ways.","post_message":"Two Shoals women are charged with exposing their children to drugs. Both women are pregnant, and are in the community corrections program. Investigators say the two failed mandatory drug tests."},{"comment_id":"935958373261405","commenter_b":"Can she get any uglier.","commenter_a":"Trash just like her parents glad they are gone","post_message":"This speaks volumes about who they are as people.

Very haughty woman.","commenter_a":"She looks like she's giving him attitude. Why's does she always have \"that\" look on her face when she looks at whites and anyone else she considers below her?","post_message":"Caption this photo in the comments! ......

Splitting hairs to rationalize your views.","commenter_a":"They got a point. It's not a religion by definition, but it's a belief system. Praying affects the individual doing it; only those offended are the people that can't stand the sight of it. They hate, if you will. Equality means just that, though. Can't restrict one group only.","post_message":"â€œThis is very scary,\" a parent wrote."}]
