When calling this election \"not by the book\" is a gross understatement. Forcing recounts in some critical swing states in a situation where the electoral vote and popular vote are completely different is a reasonable endeavor. What's absurd is how much of the establishment is willing to lie back and let this thing happen, then assure us in the same breath nothing truly terrible will come out of this administration because the establishment will prevent it. Actions speak louder than words, and the inaction of pretty much everyone other than Stein, Sanders, and Warren speaks volumes.","commenter_a":"Jill Stein, election spoiler, is going to put that money raised in her own pocket to pay her expenses.","post_message":"This Just In â€“ Just a few hours til deadline..."},{"comment_id":"635677536633830","commenter_b":"Demons","commenter_a":"@username read the top comment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚","post_message":"Name it! #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"1786615071570542","commenter_b":"Send them to Cuba , please.

The reporter all but predicted the end of the world (Communism).

What they have encouraged is the prostituition of women both in devaluing young girls and women and when they become pregnant pretending to help. But their motive all along was to take a product that costs them nothing and process it( dissect and distribute) to the highest bidder.) to be used for unimaginable purposes. This philosophy is one of the most vile known to humankind. I know a woman who was told by her father when she was a teenager if you get pregnant you nor the child will be helped by me; she would be disowned.
