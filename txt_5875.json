Let me guess, yo baby daddy is black....","commenter_a":"Its funny because in the 5th grade i refused to stand for the flag, 5th grade and i already knew this country was crap and lacked concern for its citizens. My friends grandfather was a vet from vietnam and she refused to stand for the flag out of how this country treated its troops. And she had every right and justification. You guys are missing the meaning behind the flag, you cannot just take the good of a country and claim thats all the country is. There is injustice that is constantly being negated by people like you, and those in these comments, simply because you haven't experienced it. Get over yourself and your terrible nationalistic views about a country that couldnt care less about you. Reality is reality, that flag represents a government that openly allows racism to grow and continue in our judicial and enforcement systems.","post_message":"This store owner planned a signing event with Brandon Marshall but when Marshall protested the national anthem, the owner cancelled the event immediately... but what the owner did next is going viral.

Feminism should be about equality not about following one group of women's notion about what you should look, feel or talk like.","commenter_a":"I'm seeing a lot of diversity in the Muslim community about the concept of World Hijab Day (non-Muslim women wearing the hijab for a day in solidarity). Would love to get your thoughts on whether it's cultural appropriation, or upholding the more conservative aspects of your faith. I did participate last year, but not sure if I will again.","post_message":"Her \"Ask a Muslim\" booth was a huge success! - Parker Molloy"},{"comment_id":"10154133163039032","commenter_b":"Ohhh waaaa, namecalling hurts soooo bad, better to be a pig and be free than to be \"hip\" and be a socialist. Again libtards are so out of touch with reality its scary, you all hate this country and the constitution but yet none of you have lived in anoyher country to compare. Like I said, try living in China or Cuba, or Greece, or Russia if you all think big government and socialism are so great. Btw, name calling and insults mean nothing.","commenter_a":"To the guy with \"the america was never great\" sign, why don't you go live in another country for awhile and then come back and waive that sign.

There is a legal way to come to the country, and contrary to some of the attacks I have seen on other posts, it does affect our low income Black, Hispanic, and White communities. They are used to a more extreme poverty, so they are willing to work for less than minimum wage, and are off the books, so taxes, SS are not paid. This means an American citizen or legal immigrant is denied a job. When so many of our jobs are being sent to Mexico, China, India how can we not address the issue of those who came here illegally. My nephew's wife is from Mexico. 2 of my nephews have dual citizenship. US/Brazil. I am far from racist or anti-immigration, but our own citizens and legal immigrants are suffering.

Sending women and children back into harm's way after they already fled horrendous violence in Central America is painful and inhumane, and must be stopped. Sign my petition asking President Obama to stop these raids and to make sure that families fleeing violence in Central America are protected from deportation."}]
