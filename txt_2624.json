The time is near and we must let everyone know, that If Bernie somehow doesn't win the nomination, we want him to run as a independent so we can put him in the White House. Too many people registered as independent did not have a chance to vote in closed primaries, if they did Clinton would not be leading with pledged delegates. The Democratic Party must be aware that if Bernie runs as an independent there is no chance of Clinton winning anything, so if they don't want Drumpf in the White House they should start backing Bernie now. Because there is no way in hell I'll ever vote for Clinton.","post_message":"Here's the promise I made to you on day one of this campaign: Not only will I fight to protect the working families of this country, but weâ€™re going to build a movement of millions of Americans who are prepared to stand up and fight back.
