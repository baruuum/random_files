Clearly, there's more at work here then just the convenience of sloppy people. Imagine an America with 19 million more black people, virtually all of which would vote Democrat. Things would be much different. The 55 million human lives lost since '73 would make for a vastly different nation. Democrats commit crimes against humanity in many different ways, and clearly abortion is the most depraved and reprobate of them all.","commenter_a":"They need to harvest her vagina","post_message":"“Planned Parenthood is proud of its limited role in supporting fetal tissue research.”"},{"comment_id":"10153467160786323","commenter_b":"All I am saying is there is a lot of Muslim women who use to wear more colourful suits dresses in this country who are now covering themselves up in black!","commenter_a":"I remember the days when asian women proudly wore their beautiful coloured saris and gold bangles.
