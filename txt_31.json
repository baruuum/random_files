I would also like to know how to find out who in Congress reported for work when Congress was in session. I would like to know the Congressional schedule, pay, vacation time, healthcare benefits including what company handles their care. I would like to know of any other benefits they receive, as an example- I believe there is a gym in the Congressional building. These are the questions I want answered. Please direct me to the places I can find these answers. Thank you and your team for the hard work and excellent reporting all year.
