There are some crashes that you can be in that you won't survive if you were wearing an armored suit. Its proven fact that everywhere they have changed the laws regarding wearing helmets deaths have increased. It happens around here a lot and most of the deaths are caused by head trauma, no helmet.","commenter_a":"what a tragic irony!","post_message":"A state lawmaker who voted to repeal universal helmet laws has died in a motorcycle crash. He was wearing a helmet at the time."},{"comment_id":"1689272294667942","commenter_b":"@username Bernie raises money for the party too! You didn't hear that right at all. None of Hillary's money goes to Bernie, that would be ridiculously counter productive. Duh! Both Bernie, and Hillary do raise funds for the rest of the Democratic party. This is done, to insure more Democrats get elected. That way we won't have another lame duck president. Bernie still as a very good chance, and with all the controversy, Hillary, and supporters, may have just crossed the line! Don't count chickens before they are hatched! Be ready to vote blue, no matter who the nominee. On that note, I'm voting for Bernie, it's the right choice for the majority of Americans. The wealthy don't mean a damn thing to me, as most of them feel the same about us.","commenter_a":"Wise words my ass. How can you even sit there and tell us to join together with the blatant fuckery Shillary Clinton is doing. The voter suppression. Not releasing her transcripts. Her lies. She's a corporate slug that doesn't even deserve to be in office or the government. She's as bad as the republicans. The worst part is she would probably lose to the republican nominee and y'all keep trying to shove her down our throat. What the hell are we voting for if the DNC is just gonna cheat us. Bernie or bust.","post_message":"Wise words from Robert Reich.

Another mass shooting, our country has so many. I have to have a licence to drive a car, to prove I am not so crazy as to kill people with it needlessly.
