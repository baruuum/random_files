The couple wasn't discriminated against. The kliens simply didn't want to participate in something they deem as sinful. How is that forcing their beliefs on them.

These incidents do get reported but the liberal media refuses to report on them and the militant LGBT stay silent.","post_message":"A Daily Signal Exclusive: Bakers Facing $135K Fine Over Wedding Cake for Same-Sex Couple Speak Out"},{"comment_id":"10153899755279218","commenter_b":"Ridiculous!!!
