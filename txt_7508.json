Let's see, when in office 1 went on trial for impeachment. The other has numerous investigations against her for treason, putting our national security at risk multiple times, accusations of selling American uranium to Russian companies in exchange for massive donations to \"The Clinton Foundation\" who was soliciting funds to send to the Haitians who were devastated by one of the worst earthquakes in history, yet only received a small fraction of what was raised......and while consumed with sealing her deal with the Russians, neglected action in Benghazi which cost the lives of US soldiers......... So, I don't know what Trump will do, but if I had to pick between the lesser of two evils, I would say you can't get much more evil than that witch who camouflages ...","commenter_a":"We truely don't want him in our state. We have his lil brother John Bel Boma and that is enough. We'll just hold on until Trump wins.","post_message":"Dear Mr. President: How’s the vacation going on Martha’s Vineyard? Pretty swell place for sure. Ocean breeze, beautiful homes, and packed out with America’s top 1% of the 1%—you must be in your element. And golf? I’m sure you’re playing so much golf, you’re getting almost tired of it. But then, you never tire of golf. You just seem to tire of that “Presidency thing.” My neighbors in Louisiana aren’t having it so good, Mr. President. They are underwater—again. Historic floods that have impacted or destroyed 40,000 homes and left thousands of families homeless are sure ruining their hopes for a summer vacation this year. Probably will take away hopes for a summer vacation next year as well. Their once nice homes are now waterfront property. In fact their homes don’t just front the water—they are IN the water and the water is in them. I realize that in the ..."},{"comment_id":"862078977258615","commenter_b":"Most abortions are not because of these \"terrible diseases\", so quit using that as an excuse.","commenter_a":"Conservatives are pro-life until the child is born poor.

All these gorilla whisperers and no one have any knowledge on gorilla other than from the television. The mother is 95% to blame and the zoo is 5% to blame. No way should a 4yr. old be able to find his way in there. However since he did, no one knows what the gorilla was going to do next. Saving the child should have been the first and only priority (and it was) not the gorilla. Sad the gorilla had to die but not only should humans come first but it was a baby. Some people are really crazy.","post_message":"A gorilla was killed to save a child at the Cincinnati Zoo over the weekend.
