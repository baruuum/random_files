It's not only Africa's problem this is a world wide issue. Next time you hear a piano play or go to the pub to play some billiards question what they are made of. Ivory poaching legally ended in 1989, but the demand will always be there and countries like China and Japan will always buy their way through these bans as long as we keep buying tacky souvenirs from Asia containing Ivory. Education is the key, we have to take an interest and ask what is the item I'm about to purchase made from? This is what we can do to reduce the demand of items made from threatened species.","post_message":"Poachers, beware.
