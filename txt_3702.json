Problem is that people are so selfish, narcissistic, and apathetic that they don't really LOOK at a person until its too late. Did I mention lazy? Handle problems on the front end and there will be less on the back end. Do you want to elect Carly Fiorina? Or a woman with multiple murders under her belt? Or a hatemongerer? Not my first choice, but I still like her.","post_message":"“The reason I’m running for president is because I don’t want to see hope fading from anyone’s eyes,\" Carly Fiorina said. \"When someone is addicted, you watch them disappear before your eyes.\""},{"comment_id":"10153974201673445","commenter_b":"They don't care about you & me.Ain't it always about the buck & Greed.Karma will get those Clowns.Lawsuits are coming!!

The biggest disaster of all was the video proving that she and her campaign incited the violence at his rallies. Perhaps using the word rigged is an oversimplification, but for Christ's sake, she's guilty if inciting riotous behavior.
