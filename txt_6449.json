When I worked at Walmart I would see carts like that and see that a lot of people would buy their monthly groceries at one time. So if you broke the cart down into 4 it really wouldn't be that much.","post_message":"This man noticed a difference between his cart and one in front of him in line at the checkout.

As we all know, Pelosi has been psychotic for several years. I think the question that should be answered is this: How many blind and ignorant lemming liberals have kept this shameful person in the powerful position she is in, for as many years she has been elected? That is where the real shame lies.","commenter_a":"Since when do you care about Homeland security, Nancy. You who totally have supported all that obama has done to destroy the security of our nation's borders and let millions in including criminals whose own country does not want them.
