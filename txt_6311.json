Megyn Kelly & co. continually dissected the voters by pointing out that \"Trump was losing the appeal of woman voters.\" \"That Wisconsin voters were educated and paid very close attention to details!\" How sad. Never in my life have I witnessed how the GOP could deliberately try & take down one of their own while leading the attacks against Mr. Trump in their on-going crusade \"to stop Trump!\" This is very disturbing. Cruz and that nasally annoying voice of his was carrying on as though he transformed this presidential race when in fact it was Mr. Trump who initiated the anti-establishment hostility from the moment he threw his hat in the presidential ring.
