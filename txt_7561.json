(Now) Poverty, Guns, Incarcerations! $$ facebook doesn't want you to see this $$ As long as America's richest 1%, who now possess 70% of the wealth and don't bother to vote, have the Senators in their pockets the United States Government isn't representing the will of the people, it's the 1% that's running the show. I stand with Bernie Sanders, \"We're governed by an Oligarchy.\" The number of Americans living in poverty will continue to grow while the middle class will continue to shrink and working women will continue to enrich the wealthiest 1% for the next 20 years easily!
