It's simply ensuring that people of all body types and dimensions can dress in a style which they like, and in sizes which are comfortable and flattering to their shape. Besides, being overweight isn't as simple as being a 'lifestyle' - in many cases it can come from factors as diverse as metabolism, mobility issues, eating disorders or genuine dietary or medicine requirements.","post_message":"\"Saying that high-street stores shouldn’t “facilitate” certain human beings having access to clothing, in order to make them really understand how unacceptable they are as people, is pretty nasty, right?\""},{"comment_id":"598181650332929","commenter_b":"If this is a representation of the caliber of people America is attracting we're in trouble.
