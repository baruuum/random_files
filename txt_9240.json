Any who object to a 'medieval theocracy' should take a good look at Northern Ireland if they want to see one in action.

The woman should be in prison.","commenter_a":"DO NOT be complacent. Progressives need to come out in the MILLIONS and vote. Otherwise, the Republicans/teaparty, who sold out to crazies who actually want to take a dump on the Constitution and make America a \"Christian\" Theocracy, will win.","post_message":"Republicans are losing ground in key demographics."},{"comment_id":"10153234463025779","commenter_b":"Amazing political argument Mark. You've persuaded me to support Trump with your carefully worded statement.","commenter_a":"Biff Trump is a Joke..","post_message":"It started out as a joke: Donald Trump running for president! What better way to spoof the thinness of the Republican field than to shove a bombastic reality star with orange hair, a sixth-grade vocabulary and no behavioral filter onto the GOP debate stage. But, as Matt Taibbi writes, the joke turned ugly fast."},{"comment_id":"737825183044101","commenter_b":"I would let a refugee stay in my house.","commenter_a":"I thought all of you on the left were going to let them move into your houses","post_message":"Several refugees have lost fingers and hands from walking in sub-zero temperatures."},{"comment_id":"10153047179381323","commenter_b":"Katie price is entitled to exactly the same as everyone else she is a British citizen who pays her taxes so she and her children are entitled to use the Nhs. Maybe we should be concentrating on people who arnt entitled coming to this county just for the benefits and Nhs and maybe the government should be claiming back the millions we loose in this way. I don't expect Katie price or other celebs are a drain on our economy as some people who claim benefits with no intention of ever working.","commenter_a":"The benefit system isn't struggling & costs being cut because of Katie Price, it's struggling because of the generation of freeloaders who see Benefits as a career choice, people who can work & pay taxes but don't; If everyone in this country that can work had the right work ethic we wouldn't be in half the mess we are. I was always brought up benefits are for those who need it for clothes, warmth, food, the essentials - including specialist care for the disabled, people nowadays have full sky packages watched on 50\" tvs, have a social life and go abroad for holidays all from benefits, where's the incentive then to get off their backsides and go to work. Whilst I'm not her biggest fan Katie price pays much more than her fair share in tax, she's a grafter & a worker, her son deserves his benefit rights in return","post_message":"\"This is exactly why universal benefits matter. Defend the right of mothers of disabled children, such as Price, to get help, and it reinforces the rights of everyone else. That’s how society works. Strengthen one pillar and the other gets bolder; weaken one and it won’t be long before they all start to crumble.\""},{"comment_id":"10155011219571729","commenter_b":"She can't...
