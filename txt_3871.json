They'd flown over to do this and some other jobs then planned to go back.","commenter_a":"Citizens arrest. Very good. Nice to see some black citizens using their fitness and strength to uphold the law. A good image for black people worldwide... Estonian immigrant eh? Well, well, I would contend it's a moot point whether or not he's 'enriched' the UK. He certainly is trying very hard to 'enrich' himself, although I think he should consider another profession to be honest... ;-)","post_message":"Police release CCTV footage showing members of the public in Leeds tackling an armed jewellery thief and pinning him until police arrived."},{"comment_id":"1009117072471350","commenter_b":"How typical for illegals to play the race card while obviously not understanding the term racist.","commenter_a":"No one in their right mind should support Trump","post_message":"Add Lindsey Graham to the list of Republicans who say they will not support Donald J.

The founding fathers had plenty to say for support of separation of church and state. If you are referring to the Declaration of Independence, the one time there is use of the word g-d, it is the document used for the separation from England, it is not our law or government structure. The Constitution is a secular document and no where within its body is the word G-d, bible, Jesus, etc used.","commenter_a":"Don't bank on it... Many Americans, republican & democrat, are really disturbed by the recent directions our government has dragged us...

There are NO good choices for candidates out there in either party so far.","post_message":"The 2016 map is favorable for Democrats, but margin for error is slim."}]
