Also white pride has far deeper roots tied to hatred in this country. If anything you just proved my point. When KKK have rallies it's freedom and of speech. But if latino or black communities have groups such as black panters it an extremist hate group. You people are really stupid because your racism.is exactly what is creating the modern resistance. So keep on hating and bring more peope to my side..what you think after centuries of white dominance we wouldn't eventually get tired of that shit and start fighting back?","commenter_a":"Look here's what it is. The same people that like Trump ate the same people that make Obama watermelon jokes. It's all about white privilege for you guys. What's really behind Trump's popularity is the fear that white people's dominance is being threatened. \"But Ray,\" you'll say, \" there are plenty of minorities that support Trump. \" to which I say, that the US has done an excellent job of scrubbing away people's culture and heritage and whos propaganda has thoroughly brainwashed people into extremely nationalism. Cause guess what there are plenty of white people that are against Trump as well. Face it. Trump's entire campaign is based on xenophobia and white pride may ad well be his slogan.","post_message":"'It's also to show solidarity with all the people he has tried to harass and point out we are still here and not going anywhere'"},{"comment_id":"961273403971266","commenter_b":"Very funny.","commenter_a":"It would be a GREAT pick....!

Try to stop them. There is nothing wrong with Ford investing where they want. It's a great big world. We used to lead it and WELCOME business and capitalism and now we just take and tax to DEATH.
