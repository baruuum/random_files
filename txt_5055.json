All these gorilla whisperers and no one have any knowledge on gorilla other than from the television. The mother is 95% to blame and the zoo is 5% to blame. No way should a 4yr. old be able to find his way in there. However since he did, no one knows what the gorilla was going to do next. Saving the child should have been the first and only priority (and it was) not the gorilla. Sad the gorilla had to die but not only should humans come first but it was a baby. Some people are really crazy.","post_message":"A gorilla was killed to save a child at the Cincinnati Zoo over the weekend. But there was a much different outcome when a little boy fell into a gorilla pit at an Illinois zoo nearly 20 years ago.
