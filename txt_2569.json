Why is it that everything to do with t rump is exaggerated , or just outright lies ? Every time he opens his mouth the stooges have to run around for three days explaining \"what he meant to say\"? he didn't mean women should be jailed for abortions, he meant they should be celebrated.. he didn't mean mexicans were rapists he was talking about \"the bad ones\".. he didn't mean single payer health care he meant government paid health care.. he didn't mean to call Carson a child molester he equivocated that he was LIKE a child molester.. He didn't mean to hire all those immigrants for his hotel, he meant to say Americans are lazy and won't take the low paying jobs..

Todd Young I understand your optimistic out look. How ever if you think that man will ever do anything, that would make America stronger then you greatly disappoint my opinion of you.","post_message":"While the President closed his State of the Union address by noting his desire to work across the aisle, much of his speech was spent digging in his heels on the same tax-and-spend policies rejected by the American people rather than identifying areas of common ground. But while Iâ€™m generally disappointed he took this tack, I still think there were some hints of bipartisanship that might present opportunities to grow a stronger economy. For starters, I agree with the President that Congress must pass a trade promotion authority bill. With two of the largest free trade agreements in the history of the world currently being negotiated, it is vital that the administration works with Congress to set negotiating priorities so that a deal might be completed quickly. In order to grow our economy, we must continue to open foreign markets to agricultural products and manufactured goods from places like Indiana, ..."},{"comment_id":"10155353294040231","commenter_b":"Your mom is a monkey","commenter_a":"I'm going to leave this right here. #Unapologetic #BlackAgenda @webpagelink","post_message":"Yet another black person has become a hashtag after being killed by a police officer."},{"comment_id":"10153927371866037","commenter_b":"May them leave now and so what...

It means you have strived all their lives to fulfill Christ mission and to serve God . If you don't believe in the church values and mission then why do you care who we canonize? Also when it comes to caring for people with a large organization things are much more complicated . There are many people who max out on pain killers and still feel pain in the hospitals. So when it comes to pain meds that are very valuable and they may not work why administer them ? In places like Calcutta it is not just a question of money but also transportation . They in fact hold more money then they need to but I very well doubt ...","post_message":"Is Mother Teresa a saint or an expertly-managed brand?"}]
