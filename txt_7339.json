Yes, Carson is entitled to his opinion but it shows the complete lack of understanding of the way our nation operates. A man who believes he can pick and choose which laws to obey is not qualified to run as President. Where are all the Christians who were crying about religious liberty? This man wants to take away the religious liberty of a very large portion of those practicing a different religion. A very sad day for America and those haters bashing the Muslim faith.","post_message":"A call for Dr. Ben Carson to drop out: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"618782741607379","commenter_b":"She will never do it","commenter_a":"I can only see myself supporting Clinton if we have direct representation in her administration.
