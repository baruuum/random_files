It wasn't long, however, before a number of commenters rallied to the Tennessee teenager's defense. One person posted: \"It's obvious this woman is beautiful, inside and out.\" Another wrote that the dress \"looks absolutely stunning.\" Layne had originally tried selling the gown for $350, but supporters have now raised more than $2,700 to help her buy a new dress for her senior prom.
