Hillary was the very worst candidate, with way too much baggage. It had nothing to do with gender. Most women would have voted for a woman who had not lied and had not been under FBI investigation. Wikileaks showed just how dishonest her campaign was.","post_message":"Grieving Democrats and pundits point to gender bias as a culprit for Trump's win â€” but an October poll disproves them."},{"comment_id":"1209490769090378","commenter_b":"Hillary is no lady she is more of a whore.","commenter_a":"We've already learned that this lady is a huge liar. What she says, and what she can do, are 2 different things. Obama just got blocked, so, hopefully this we won't have to worry about it and Trump will just be elected. Fingers crossed.","post_message":"DON'T let this woman be elected!!! @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1669966499994538","commenter_b":"Dumb. Completely fucking dumb if you vote for her.

These things you don't know, and here you are cheering on this invasion of privacy for all am users, because you don't align morally with a subset of users.
