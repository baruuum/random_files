I was trying NOT to be cynical, but was wondering, if you hust had dinner with your wife, and you're entering an elevator, what possible reason do you have to unholster your weapon? Makes you go hmmmmmmmm","commenter_a":"Poor guy ..... perfect example of ALWAYS following safety procedures. If he was off duty, why didn't he have the safety on? But hey, nobody's perfect, and he is paying dearly for this mistake, physically, and I'm SURE! at his job with the ribbing he's getting frim his fellow officers.","post_message":"A Kentucky police officer accidentally shot himself while standing next to his wife in a Cincinnati elevator, and the entire incident was captured by surveillance video. Officer Darryl Jouett removed his gun from its holster and was apparently trying to put it in his pocket when it went off. A bullet ricocheted off the elevator door and hit him in the stomach. Jouett on Monday told WCPO - 9 On Your Side he was at home and on the mend.

Unless we get rid of all the illegals there is no money.. Oh and the muslims that Obama let in here..LOL","commenter_a":"Mr. @username, Like where you're going. I would 1st Cut Welfare 100% and give it all to the Vets, they have earned it. Close the border and start kicking out un-documented, non tax paying illegals. Bring jobs back to the U.S.A, and repeal oshitcare. Also free up the 2nd A. If you Hate this Country Ask the Government for a ONE WAY TICKET to anywhere in the world.

But doggier....she \"kept\" you. She got you back. By completely NOT ANYTHING like what you thought you married. She's an evil, money-hungry, evil, liar, in a position in government she shouldn't even be a janitor that empties her garbage can, ugly (well, she's always been ugly) and a moral-less female. So I guess it does end up how it should be in the end. She should sit in jail the rest of her life. You two are the epitome if what a marriage should not ever be. And you sound proud! You're both despicable.","commenter_a":"Terri Bock","post_message":"\"I married my best friend.
