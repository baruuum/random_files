The phrase well regulated militia did not mean the same thing that people understand it to be now. At that time well regulated meant that every man was to be completely equipped on his own dime. Every citizen was expected to be armed and ready to defend their community. Consider that at that time there were still unfriendly hostiles that raided towns and farms. Each citizen was expected to be armed and would have been quite foolish not to be. These days as civilization seems to be degenerating we are also faced with the dangers of criminals and terrorists and yes even perhaps our own government. People have been conditioned to be drones who don't bother with thinking so they let the government do it for them. What they fail to realize is that the government ...","commenter_a":"People have rights, not militias. Militias depend on people having rights, people's rights do not depend on being in a militia. Let's parse this: The 2nd Amendment consists of two clauses. The first clause \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\" is a dependent clause, because it is not a complete sentence. It cannot stand on its own. The second clause \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\" forms a complete sentence, it is an independent clause. The first clause is dependent on the second clause. Or, in simple English, the existence of a militia (which is essential to the security of a free State), is DEPENDENT on people having un-infringed rights, not the other way around. No laws, licenses, permits or taxes that by design are designed to keep Americans from exercising their 2A right can ...","post_message":"California Lt. Gov.
