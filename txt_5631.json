I don't know that Trump would be good, but so far he seems better to me than her. Sadly the Libertarian candidate has too many views that are not on par with me and it is in the areas that matter most to me. Trump shares my stance on all of the issues that have come out thus far.","commenter_a":"TRUMP....you better not bail on us man.
