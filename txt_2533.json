They have been living off of the tax payers for years without one concern for the US Citizens. People, wake up. Take a good long look at your life, are you living better now or five years ago? or even 10 years ago, Is your income the same, are you now needing to work 2 jobs just to make ends meet. People, we are now competing with our teenagers for the jobs we held as teenagers to learn responsibility just to make ends meet. Wake up people, I don't think this is what our parents believed was the American Dream. And we certainly aren't living better than they did. Think long and hard about your future and that of your children and the generations to come, will they have a FUTURE!!!!!!","post_message":"Whoa!!
