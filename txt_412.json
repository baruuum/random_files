Leo Forrest was born in Armenia last month. Upon learning of the genetic condition, his mother and her family gave up on the child. They also told Samuel Forest he would no longer be welcome in their home if they decided to keep him, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help Forrest and the baby. Faced with a difficult choice -- his wife or his infant son the new father chose Leo. She has since filed for divorce, he says. Forrest is returning to Auckland, New Zealand, where he is originally from, to raise the baby.
