You can choose to be a stay at home mom now, you are no longer forced.","commenter_a":"Feminism got women the right to vote, and the right to be equally taxed as men without suffering any of the consequences of their choices (like fighting in war) obviously women are indirectly affected by war too but....this devalued their job and oppourtunities as mothers, thus hurting the family structure by putting extra financial burdens on them to cover the extra tax load.
