I commend the Pittsburg community for rejecting this decision and I stand with them. The Constitution guarantees a right to freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. This banner is not only an expression of faith, but of love for country. Expressions of patriotism, faith, and community should be welcome in our society and I have contacted USPS officials to express my concerns about their decision and to request their reconsideration. If the local post office branch is unwilling to display the banner, then I would be proud to hang it at my own office in Pittsburg."},{"comment_id":"527878314072059","commenter_b":"Put her in jail!!!!!!","commenter_a":"To recap: Hillary is \"the devil\" and has \"hatred in her heart\" and Trump is going to appoint a special prosecutor to \"put her in jail.\" This is how a democracy slouches into totalitarianism.","post_message":"Your reaction to the second presidential debate?"},{"comment_id":"10153801376773822","commenter_b":"Sean Hile lol","commenter_a":"Chelsea Nichole","post_message":"Burgers, Wings, and Country music...
