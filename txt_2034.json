The phrase well regulated militia did not mean the same thing that people understand it to be now. At that time well regulated meant that every man was to be completely equipped on his own dime. Every citizen was expected to be armed and ready to defend their community. Consider that at that time there were still unfriendly hostiles that raided towns and farms. Each citizen was expected to be armed and would have been quite foolish not to be. These days as civilization seems to be degenerating we are also faced with the dangers of criminals and terrorists and yes even perhaps our own government.

Or, in simple English, the existence of a militia (which is essential to the security of a free State), is DEPENDENT on people having un-infringed rights, not the other way around. No laws, licenses, permits or taxes that by design are designed to keep Americans from exercising their 2A right can ...","post_message":"California Lt. Gov.
