If you want representation of the people, you're looking in the wrong chamber.","commenter_a":"It is a very good thing that urban power centres cannot set the taxes of their rural neighbours. If they could the rural producers would become slaves and would have no quality of life in the pursuit of urban consumers actively destroying rural methods of negotiation. This is NOT a failing of the system, it is exactly why the system is in place. It is a good thing that farmers are not economic slaves of nearby cities.","post_message":"In the U.S. Senate, the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before."},{"comment_id":"10157871036080354","commenter_b":"@username that just shows how dumb you are!

Is Obama an American that received funding from foreigners? Did he just get student loans and work hard? Is Obama keeping his records confidential to cover something even bigger than Obama himself? Ask yourself this question, would opening up Obama‚Äôs Harvard records cause people to closely examine the influence of oil rich Arabs that may want to impose Islam on the United States?
