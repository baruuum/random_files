The #1 cause of abortion is unplanned pregnancy. Universal coverage for birth control has done a great job of reducing abortions in other countries. Equal pay guarantees also work - mothers in this country experience a greater wage gap than childless women. Job protection is an issue here. Women in this country still experience job loss solely because of pregnancy. And, child support is a huge problem here. Civilized countries pay custodial parents child support, and THEN collect it from the non-custodial parent. Knowing that you can afford to feed, house, and clothe a child is a factor when deciding whether to continue a pregnancy.","commenter_a":"If these conservatives really wanted to prevent abortions -- they should be handing out birth control like it was candy. After all, if you prevent an unwanted pregnancy you automatically prevent the need for an abortion. But I guess that kind of logic is beyond the comprehension of most conservatives. Considering the conservatives are trying to restrict or elimiminate access to birth control as well -- I don't think this is about preventing abortions at all. It seems like it's about a group of morally uptight religious busybodies going around poking their noses into other people's private matters and wanting to have total control over those people's lives.","post_message":"Trevor encourages abortion opponents to extend their pro-life stance beyond fetuses."}]
