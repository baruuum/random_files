She needs an oily dildo to be happy again!","commenter_a":"Mr. Trump please get back to talking about jobs and the border problems and ignore the pundits like Matthews. You need to talk more about Cruz being an insider too. That is not stressed enough in your campaign. You can win but have to talk about what the average American is worried about. God Bless you. I will be voting for you in Pennsylvania.","post_message":"Wait until I do not have to take on 16 candidates at once. I will be Hillary's worst nightmare!

Censorship at a students union is about as bad as it gets, but it does not surprise me given the 'right on' nature of some idealistic fools in the student world.","commenter_a":"And the pandering to the nasty ideology goes on, unfortunately!","post_message":"'They’re basically labelling me a racist'"},{"comment_id":"1202403033149557","commenter_b":"Greg is right and you Libtards are in denial.","commenter_a":"To understand what Hillary and her leadership will do to America. all you have to do is look at our Democrat run cities. Poverty, Crime, Drugs and Hatred. Syrian Refugees and Open Boarders will only add fuel to the fire! Democrats do not want prosperity for everyone, they want to keep the poor dependent so they can perpetuate their cause of corruption and lies. It is a fact. An obvious fact. Only selfish, bleeding heart liberals could be so ignorant as to the facts and the reality of the situation. It is a joke. @webpagelink","post_message":"The women of the U.S. Senate are fighting to make their firsts the first of many."},{"comment_id":"10154124888373812","commenter_b":"The jobs that illegal immigrents work in this country are jobs that, #1 citizens of this country are unwilling to work and #2 jobs that employers are not willing to pay a fair wage for.
