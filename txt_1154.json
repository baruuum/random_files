Problem solved.","commenter_a":"$7.25/hr equates to about $1250 a month before taxes. After taxes let's say $1000. I live in a studio apartment in CA and it's $885/mo. So $115 remains for 4 weeks of food, utilities, transportation to and from the job? Get real, America. Especially for a family even $15/hr would be a stretch, but it'd be better.","post_message":"It is a national disgrace that millions of full-time workers are living in poverty and millions more are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay their bills. A job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage."},{"comment_id":"10154738479449575","commenter_b":"Hanna Mae Klemann there you go","commenter_a":"No","post_message":"Arby's is testing out venison sandwiches at select locations for just a few bucks!
