If you have to use illegal immigrants for less than minimum wage in order to make your business work, you do not deserve to be in business. Americans are gonna have to learn to put down the bag of cheeto's and do some actual work or these immigrants need to be legalized,be paid a fair wage and pay taxes like the rest of us. When they try to do what they do with TV's and cellphones and have it made with slave wages in other countries,we need to not allow them to sell their products here or fine them to the point of it not being overly profitable by doing this. With that being said ,same needs to be done with TV, cellphone,shoes,clothes etc. People being used as slaves in order for these companies to make major profits and so everyone can afford these ...","post_message":"Turns out America's food production relies heavily on immigrant labor, and our farmers are NOT pleased."},{"comment_id":"1766246316922622","commenter_b":"@username don't be nervous I'll only use My 2nd Amendment if you were to try to come into my home & try to harm my Family.

I will bet all I have, that if one of you ever find yourself in a situation like the one this douche bag is referring to, which 99,9 to 100 % of you never will, you and your gun won't do anything but piss your pants. Guns would not have stopped this, nor any other terrorist attack, just like guns isn't stopping anything in your country, quite the opposite in fact. You won't see european people from Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels or any other high risk cities demand a right to carry guns, because we don't want to, because we know it don't work and because we are not stupid. Trump is a freaking idiot and sadly many of you Americans are brainwashed and scared so easily.
