My wife doesn't just not mind, she really likes my beard. As for the women \" that do were and are not interested\" in me- I couldn't care less, they are irrelevant. I have a beautiful wife. You are right in that everyone has physical preferences, I for one am not attracted to women with silicone breasts and/or mullets. Perhaps one day soon, when you hit the menopause, you might grow yourself a fine, full beard and be proud of it. All the best!","commenter_a":"If you can grow a beard, then why not? I really couldn't care less if someone finds my beard unsightly. You should be proud of your masculinity, not try and disguise it. I spend most of the daylight hours outside, the beard helps protects me from the elements and from those of a nervous disposition.","post_message":"Just one more reason to love beards!"},{"comment_id":"955856331137563","commenter_b":"Based on what I've seen it's because they are ugly and no man will take care of them.","commenter_a":"Why are liberal women unable to take care of themselves?

In fact if she wants to wear that shirt she should have to make a presentation showing fax and citations from non-biased source is why she thinks it's true!","post_message":"The teen said she was asked to take the shirt off after it sparked a debate in class."},{"comment_id":"960758160629087","commenter_b":"Now chelsea clinton that is one fucking butt ugly girl!!
