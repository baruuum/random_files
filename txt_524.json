Also, her derri√®re is not going to effect the shape of the intake. It is designed to handle air pressure from 250 knot IAS relative wind that at altitude could be as high as 550 knots TAS. So, what's the big deal? I think the picture looks COOL!!!","commenter_a":"I do not think so.

It just shows how little thought he's put into what he's saying. The environmental impact alone would be devastating. My problem with Trump is, if he were somehow to get elected, when he didn't get his way he would just say \"I'm going back to my life as a billionaire where I get my way and everything has a price so I can have what I want\". He's made that statement in one of his speeches. He said \"you might not like my statements and I may not get elected for them. So what, I'll just go back to my life of wealth\".","post_message":"How would Donald Trump crack down on ISIS as president? Let's just say he has a bold plan.
