It's the government. They want to go to other countries and spend trillions of our tax dollars on them and try to get those mid east countries to be more civilized. Well, you can't teach a baboon how to talk and you surely can't teach these primitive thinking tribes to be civil. So the only thing they know is to try to rule the world and get the whole world to be on their level. As for that Boston Bomber mother.....your fu*kface son will burn in hell way before your 'people' get a chance to try to burn America down! And you'll be under ground too and will never see America burn. America's too strong of a Nation for that. Even with this Muslim president.","commenter_a":"Hey, your religion aint working.","post_message":"@webpagelink"}]
