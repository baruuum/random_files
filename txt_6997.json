And then for extra shits and giggles we'll say that you're a burden on society and need to pull yourself up by the bootstraps.","post_message":"Not content with being a mere robot who repeats the same scripted line over and over during a debate, Marco Rubio demonstrated that he is a cold heartless robot on Sunday."},{"comment_id":"639543372893417","commenter_b":"As I said the jobs are what this is all about. Yet we continue to give unlimited tax breaks to these major corporations to stay here. Just look at all the money LOANED to GM that has never wholly been repaid and never will. Major corporations are \"pimping\" themselves out so WE the middle class can continue to pay for all their tax breaks. When our American companies relocate outside of our country they should be heavily taxed for importing there product here. Since they're paying these third world workers nothing anyway for once let's get into their profits.","commenter_a":"Oh well thank you is in order for saving those jobs. Too bad we the middle class have to make up for that $7m tax break you just gave them. What should have been done is let them leave and import their products back here and tax the crap out of them.

People came from other towns and cities with food and other things that were badly needed during this time. I understand these ladies went above and beyond and for that I applaud them. But we should not forget all the other people that helped and are still here helping. While the kids are a very important part of our community there are still people working to rebuild what has taken them a lifetime to obtain. I just want to thank all the people who were here when we were at our worst.","commenter_a":"Very cool","post_message":"WATCH: Educators in Lumberton, NC, hit hard by Hurricane Matthew, get $50,000, a brand new playground and funds to rebuild 16 parks! @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"954073617997796","commenter_b":"Hate speech.
