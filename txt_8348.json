You are are misinformed in your information as we all have taken classes about tanning. My mother died of melanoma and never tanned a day in her life we get SOOOOO MANY people with medical conditions who have to tan some of which are young girls. Now they passed the new law in 2014 on minors but we are WIDELY sought out and remained a tanning salon for 17 years!!! You have to educate yourself on it. The media is giving it such a horrible rep just like they do with everything to make you all freak out the exact way u are. If we didn't know what we were talking about then why do we have clients come who beat breast cancer with a doctors note or psoriasis or cystic acne or ms eczema the list goes on. Your body NEEDS vitamin D ...","post_message":"The FDA proposed unprecedented new rules Friday that would bar anyone under 18 from using a tanning booth or sunlamp."}]
