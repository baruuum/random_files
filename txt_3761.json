But hey, nobody's perfect, and he is paying dearly for this mistake, physically, and I'm SURE! at his job with the ribbing he's getting frim his fellow officers.","post_message":"A Kentucky police officer accidentally shot himself while standing next to his wife in a Cincinnati elevator, and the entire incident was captured by surveillance video. Officer Darryl Jouett removed his gun from its holster and was apparently trying to put it in his pocket when it went off. A bullet ricocheted off the elevator door and hit him in the stomach. Jouett on Monday told WCPO - 9 On Your Side he was at home and on the mend.
