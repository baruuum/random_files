I believe in equality, rights and fair treatment of all. Men, women, and all races, but I'm not a feminist. I support my family the best way I can now which is to stay home and take care of them. My children are smarter and safer with me here, plus they have a structured living environment. I plan on getting a p/t job when they both start full time school but as for now this is where I'm needed. And I love every minute of it even the hard days.","post_message":"Ellen Page has a point here, ya know...

But Rubio wouldn't know about a business or for that matter what it's like to take a job and show up to work! Only be a puppet whipping boy for the old lifetime old farts on the hill.
