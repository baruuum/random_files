LOL ok.","commenter_a":"Killing for fun. \"End of the moral analysis\" The \"arguments\" of the article are pathetic. \"letâ€™s not forget that wildlife reserves can also kill lions.\" Oh, right, I had forgotten that in this world, \"I'm not the only one to do bad\" is considered an argument. I'm not a fan of any carnivorous animal, but if you decide that they're a problem, you'd better come up with solutions that are more ethical than their own actions.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10153385022372426","commenter_b":"@username-this is for that mouth of yours.
