They were put in place to prevent someone like her who wins the popular vote but is un-electable in the general election from costing the Dems the WH. The question is are they too corrupt and blind to fulfill their intended purpose which is to give the nomination to Bernie.","post_message":"“I think clearly that the superdelegate model was designed to stop outsider candidates like [Bernie Sanders], and in that sense, they’re doing what they’re designed to do,” said Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich."},{"comment_id":"10153369191183984","commenter_b":"Yes it is.The best we can do is try to covert those that are a,ready here.

So she did the crime, now do the punishment she had her choice.","commenter_a":"....she killed the guy, put his head in a pressure cooker and then chop the rest of him before telling anybody. Do you know how long that must have been? china did exactly what was right and her sentence isnt harsh at all. Anyone asking for a lighter sentence is out of their mind. She needs to sit in jail for a while and maybe see a head doctor.","post_message":"Women in China who killed abusive spouses were once routinely executed, but as the scale of domestic violence began to emerge in the early 2000s — officials say one in four marriages is affected, activists say one in three — lengthy prison sentences became the norm instead."}]
