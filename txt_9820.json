Remember, Cruz though he has his good points, he still \"wears the Republican & Special Interests chain\" he forged by accepting campaign contributions. Also, remember fort 7 long, long, long years...he didn't constatnly call for John Boehner (sober?) to call for The House Sergeant-at-Arms to arrest \"Barry O from Honolulu\" for multiple counts of High Treason, violation of The Presidential Oath of Office, failing to defend The Constitution, and counts of U.S. Treasuyr Embezzlement of Funds to illegally fund bogas business startups that failed, disappeared, and the money disappeared as well.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10153190438888812","commenter_b":"Plus many red states consider sand and salt a slippery slope toward Socialism.","commenter_a":"All the Yankees talking about \"that isn't snow!\" Must not realize how right they are.
