The magnitude of the President's executive overreach on immigration cannot be ignored.

It is my sincere hope that Senate Democrats see this legal action as a wakeup call and let the House bill be considered in the Senate."},{"comment_id":"10153927132326680","commenter_b":"She is nasty","commenter_a":"I rewound my tv three times when I heard this because I couldn't believe a presidential candidate would actually say something like this.","post_message":"Donald J.
