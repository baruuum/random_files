So I have to take a break.. Also I get discouraged when people call me names :(","commenter_a":"They didn't say \"get over it.\" They promised to look into it, did so, and concluded that their pop culture reference was fine and that people misconstruing it would be in the minority and no changes needed to be made. Kinda funny how you can spin a story with a contentious headline. Ben & Jerry's seemed concientuous and compassionate here, not combative and dismissive as the headline suggests.","post_message":"These folks became very upset over the name of Ben & Jerry's new ice cream flavor and demanded it be changed.
