ENOUGH WITH POLITICAL PROPAGANDA, ENOUGH WITH PROPAGANDA. BRING BACK JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY OR GET THE HELL OUT OF THE BUSINESS, WE WILL NOT GO DOWN THE ROAD TO SOCIALISM. WE WILL FIGHT, WE WILL WIN.","commenter_a":"Sieg heil!!! ;-)","post_message":"A free press is a pillar of democracy. So when Trump called CNN \"fake news,\" this Fox News anchor chose to stand by his fellow journalists."},{"comment_id":"474511766072737","commenter_b":"Can't do that until you remove the Muslim president who encourages them to take over.","commenter_a":"we need to take our Country back. We outnumber them let stop the insanity. Dont let any mosks be built in this country. We cant build Churches in theirs. If they dont like it here than leave. No one would care.","post_message":"Muslims force this school to ban Christian holidays. America is under attack, this is treasonous. 'LIKE' if banning Easter is WRONG!"},{"comment_id":"10153517171806336","commenter_b":"Shut up you stupid woman!","commenter_a":"They were only 160 ft. Away and actually they checked on the children throughout the night. It is said the mother visits the place where the child went missing to walk the streets hoping to find her. The parents are devastated over the loss. Just because you or I would not leave our children like this doesn't mean we should be so critical or unkind. They made a terrible mistake ( in this case perhaps a deadly one). We should show kindness and pray for them. I mean after all what if it were you/me. No one is beyond making mistakes. They are tortured enough. Walk a mile in their shoes.","post_message":"Based on an examination of the bones, Australian police determined the child was killed \"some time since the start of 2007\" â€“ the same year Madeleine McCann disappeared."},{"comment_id":"10153634972561350","commenter_b":"She looks good to me. Very feminine. I like it when ladies dress nice in the workplace.","commenter_a":"I mean, I'm just saying as a former JCP employee, but during our training it was made really clear that nobody was allowed to wear shorts, male or female. We were given a packet with what was okay to wear and what wasn't. The dress code is established before you even start working, so I don't really see the problem with them sending her home.","post_message":"This woman says she was sent home for wearing these shorts to work -- which she purchased in the store's career style section."},{"comment_id":"1175128772557320","commenter_b":"This one nah woman?","commenter_a":"You didn't lose because you're a woman. You lost because of all the horrible things you did. Trump might have said a couple bad things, but you did many bad things. You spend our enemies money bashing him and he funded himself. I can't wait till he's in office and saying Merry Christmas is ok again and don't have to worry about offending someone for saying it. He WILL make America great again. GOD bless him.","post_message":"Scripture tells us: Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart."},{"comment_id":"591215384344977","commenter_b":"Wash your mouth lady!","commenter_a":"Ummm it's not a white thing, it's a hygiene thing.....","post_message":"Imagine if a Republican had said this about Black people...... They'd be destroyed."},{"comment_id":"940190486114130","commenter_b":"What a fucking shitbag","commenter_a":"Bill Clinton was President and the Commander in Chief during part of my time in the National Guard. I had no respect for him as a man but had I ever encountered him I would have rendered proper military courtesy out of respect for the office of the President. When you put on the uniform you mo longer get to pick and choose.","post_message":"HA! She should've thought twice..."}]
