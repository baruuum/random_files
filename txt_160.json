Read the book, \"While Europe Slept!\" Once we get a Christian president in the USA, the Muslims here will go back to their cubby holes. The Muslim president we have are giving them a very false sense of security.","commenter_a":"Unbelievable. They don't want to follow American customs, go back to wherever you came from.","post_message":"This school just ordered parents to make sure their daughters made Muslims happy in a sick way... this is full-on surrender.

That's it.","commenter_a":"Im still confused. Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. ðŸ˜•","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."}]
