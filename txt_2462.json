Wouldn't saying \"He can't do that\" because of the brand name be like saying girls can't play Gameboy because it has 'boy' in the name?

Jesus did not need a million dollars to spread the Word of God and there is no other as Him. Nor did his disciples. They taught the Word and lived the Word and never did they live as lavishly as these preachers. Many of you are saying that IRS should not get involved and the people should do something about it. The problem is that no one is and the blatant greed and lavish lifestyles is out of control - and what is the absolute worst- it is all done \"in the name of the Lord\". Sorry folks, these are not churches. They are tax free money making machines that feed off of very good hearted Christian people that just want to do their best to live according to the Word and these \"preachers\" know just what ...","post_message":"I can't believe this is happening.
