With the whole Confederate \"battle\" flag all employees probably got a notice with its picture on it saying why Walmart wants nothing to do with it. Common sense people. Also total set up to prove a point that we choose at the moment what we're going to have a hissy fit about and how worse things could totally go under the radar because of the uneducated and ignorant people out there. I guarantee you most people couldn't recognize 3 out of any of the 50 state flags and I'm being generous with that!

Went back yesterday and managed to get an ISIS battle flag printed. ISIS happens to be somebody we’re fighting against right now who are killing our men and boys overseas and are beheading Christians.\" Now, the chain is apologizing and says the ISIS cake \"should not have been made.\" @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"274137179658285","commenter_b":"@username paying for this useless wall?

It just shows how little thought he's put into what he's saying. The environmental impact alone would be devastating. My problem with Trump is, if he were somehow to get elected, when he didn't get his way he would just say \"I'm going back to my life as a billionaire where I get my way and everything has a price so I can have what I want\". He's made that statement in one of his speeches. He said \"you might not like my statements and I may not get elected for them. So what, I'll just go back to my life of wealth\".","post_message":"How would Donald Trump crack down on ISIS as president? Let's just say he has a bold plan.

Now, the Department of Children and Family Services supervisor who was fired after it was determined he missed opportunities to save the 8-year-old Palmdale boy is close to getting his job back. Gregory Merritt was among those who decided to close Gabriel case shortly before his death even though he knew the boy had written a suicide note and had a BB gun pellet embedded in his chest. A civil service panel recently voted unanimously to reinstate Merritt, imposing a 30-day suspension in lieu of termination, the L.A. Times reported. Read KTLA story here: @webpagelink"}]
