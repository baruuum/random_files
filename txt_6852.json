But the arrogant ought to be circumspect.","commenter_a":"One simple question: for the Christians who believe that life begins at conception; if God wants every potential human \"life\" to be born so much so that you have to create laws that every American woman whether they believe the bronze age fairy story or not, why when god destroyed all life during the Noah flood did he kill pregnant women?

Aside from the idiotic general opinion of the public, I've met more illegals that really want to be here to work and provide a better life for their families.
