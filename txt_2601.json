Some kids are born with indeterminate sex and as they get older they transition from the sex they were assigned to the one that really fits. Don't make this something it's not.","post_message":"The Obama administration is telling public schools that they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153751890519411","commenter_b":"Fuck Israel baby killers.","commenter_a":"The alleged tens of thousands of “rockets” from Gaza killed how many Israelis so far? How many? Palestine has a legal right of self-defense whether Israel likes it or not. Saying that Israel is a victim is like saying that Hitler acted in self defense. Israel has no more right to Palestine than the Nazis had over Austria, Hungary, Poland, etc... In 2000, 57 Arab and Islamic countries offered full diplomatic recognition of Israel if they returned to 1967 borders. Israel never acknowledged this offer. Israel kills in the name of self defense. US kills in the name of democracy. When they fight back they are called terrorists. When it is said to them: \"Make not mischief on the earth,\" they say: \"We are only peacemakers.\" [Quran 2:11] Isn't this the case today... in the name of Freedom and Democracy!

Politics is no longer about helping American people. To all these politicians it is PURLEY about personal gain and saying ANYTHING and doing ANYTHING for votes. I wonder why we can't fix our economy with millions and millions of illegals taking jobs and paying ZERO taxes. It's a travesty and a COMPLETE INJUSTICE to ACTUAL HARD WORKING AMERICANS!","commenter_a":"It's the dirty, lying, self-righteous, power hungry B Sers who allowed this Illegal Immigration to go on for political gains and votes. Migration laws continually are being broken by both parties to either gain or expand their political power. They could care less how it's affecting the American citizen tax payers, by costi g them Billions of dollars per year to feed them, send them to school, healthcare, and their babies born here become immediately American citizens. Trump in 2026 for POTUS, to eliminate this millstone around the neck of the tax payers.","post_message":"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe illegal immigration is a problem..."},{"comment_id":"865107826951175","commenter_b":"Who cares / she's useless","commenter_a":"And, Donald Trump(ish) is not racist, bigoted, arrogant, insensitive, and lacking in political comprehension ???","post_message":"Fauxcahontas."},{"comment_id":"10155881549390354","commenter_b":"Melissa !

If it was, DoD finance screwed up AGAIN and will correct that issue shortly. They apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused.","commenter_a":"Not sure why people are complaining about buying them. That's what a CLOTHING ALLOWANCE is for. It's nothing new. We had to buy our own ACU's too when they came out. I used my Star Card to get a couple sets and then paid myself back with my clothing allowance. Pretty simple.","post_message":"Soldiers can start buying the newest camo pattern on July 1 – the one that looks strikingly similar to what soldiers have been wearing in Afghanistan for years."}]
