The law also imposes steep fines and possible jail time for any agent and modeling agency who hire them. The law focuses on the model Body Mass Index (BMI) and bans anyone whose BMI is, according to the law, than levels proposed by health authorities and decreed by the ministers of health and labor. Opponents of the law think that the criteria for banning a model is too rigid; that BMI alone is not a good judge of who is and isn healthy. Others, though, say they happy the law is put in place. They think the law will stop glorifying an unhealthy body image. #9HotTopics What do you think?
