Elizabeth Warren of playing the “race card” when she attempted, on the Senate floor, to read a letter written by Coretta Scott King in order to make her case against Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. “It’s almost like a bait and switch, stir up the emotions, in the name of King—and my name is Alveda King—stir up people’s emotions, play the race card, which she was attempting to do,” King, who supported Donald Trump for president, said Wednesday on Fox Business Network.
