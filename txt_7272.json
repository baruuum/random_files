Definitely our country has had already more than enough from LYING lawyers turning politicians! After all, LYING is the job they do best and nothing else really matters to them. Talking to many Hispanic,- with common sense- good friends of mine, I found out that they all agreeing with DONALD TRUMP! And it's not because they aren't hospitable and compassionate people. To the contrary! It's because of the fact that most of these illegal bad apples in their efforts to blend in and avoid being getting caught, always have settled in their neighborhoods bringing their drugs their street gang attitudes and criminal ways with, and my friends are the very first to have been victimized by. Now of course not all illegals are bad, but some are and one is too many.
