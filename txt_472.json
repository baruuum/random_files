Lots of parents I know say they prefer the class donation as they may not always get a chance to shop or might not know the child well enough to personalise the gift.","commenter_a":"Let me put forth a different perspective: my kids are in classes with 20 odd children in - this is excluding family and family friends who attend the parties. At birthdays if all the class kids attend that's 20 gifts. You are hard pressed to find something cheaper than 10 quid these days and most individual presents cost more so if everyone gives 10 quid it lands up being more affordable for a lot of people, means a lot less clutter in what are often small London homes or apartments, and collectively with say 200 pounds a child can get one substantial gift like a bike or it could go towards something the parents need for their child. I genuinely don't see an issue with this at all and fail to see how this is a middle class issue.","post_message":"Oh, dear. // BuzzFeed UK"},{"comment_id":"1179451428768183","commenter_b":"Blacks on a welfare leash! also remember the KKK WAS STARTED BY THE DEMOCRATS. the first RUNAWAY Slave tracked down by a Democrat Government and the first legal slave was owned by another BLACK MAN ,, SO WHO YOU VOTING FOR ??","commenter_a":"Bastard, who opened the vault holding our Social Security.","post_message":"Here's the HARD TRUTH about what the Democrat party has REALLY done to the Black community,."},{"comment_id":"10154038199220470","commenter_b":"Dang! 2 females!
