Prior to last Friday, Bibi and his gang gave lip service to the two-state solution, willingness to talk with the Pals, preservation of human rights. And did the opposite, much of the time. They don't have to bluff anymore. And by the by, it's strange to hear the man who's tried to bypass the administration for almost all of its eight years, you supported Obama's opponent in 08, talk about underhand tactics.","post_message":"You might think that something actually happened last Friday at the UN, writes David Rosenberg"},{"comment_id":"1563613390592441","commenter_b":"fucking bitch","commenter_a":"Let the parents kick the bitch with steel toe shoes in the head","post_message":"This woman should be in jail!"},{"comment_id":"1727453857514316","commenter_b":"@username,just like your husbands grandparents came in the 30s,my grandparents also came here but in1907 and came threw Eli's Island LEGALLY which was harder to do in 1907 ..so there is no excuse for some coming here illegally today,none what so ever!!","commenter_a":"Trump wants illegals gone and so do I. My dad came to this country legally and at age 65 is still going strong. My brothers are so fortunate and blessed that my parents have given us this opportunity to make something out of ourselves. Seeing illegals demand stuff and act like they deserve things we Americans worked hard for burns me up inside. Illegals have no rights to anything and should be deported and forced to go through legal channels to attain citizenship like other immigrants. We need a wall or a stronger more secure border and absolutely no amnesty for these criminals","post_message":"\"Donald Trump is not a racist.\" Today, in front of Trump Tower, Donald J.
