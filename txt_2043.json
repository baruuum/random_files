The religious faith of Muslims includes belief in Allah as the only god, (deity) and in Muhammad his prophet. And if anyone does not believe in Allah, they must be killed as infidels (non-believers)! Their goal and ideology world wide since the inception of Islam in 700 AD is to convert the world to Islam or kill them as non- believers! Notice what's been happening worldwide the past eight years? The Quran is their teaching book ALL Muslims learn from and live by daily. It makes up 99% of who they are and how they live.

If they are fleeing Africa for political reasons, or because they fear for their lives, then and only then might they have a valid claim to stay in Europe. But if they're just fleeing because they're poor, they should move to Europe legally, or simply make the best of what they've got in Africa. Tough titties.
