Trump is an opportunistic bigot who has historically enjoyed good relations with Muslims but to become elected, he has jumped on the bandwagon of Islamaphobia. Attacking the Mexican community is also another opportunistic attempt to create hatred, division and anger. The most beautiful thing about America is its a nation of immigrants.
