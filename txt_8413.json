There are more homes and apartments being built and the more we build the more we invade their homes. It becomes harder for then to hunt for food. So then they move into our towns and cities because people leave trash around everywhere.","post_message":"Update: 5-year-old boy survived the attack. His mom fought the animal off.

Disney World was actually built around swamps. Yes they altered the swamps and created the lagoon but it has always had alligators in it. Sorry a toddler died because of the lack of understanding of that fact.","commenter_a":"Give me a break. My 7 year old heard about this and the first thing she said is \"why would they go near the water? It's Florida! Everyone knows there are alligators in Florida!\".

They were very verbally upset with the illegals. You see their whole family was born in Mexico and they all moved to Oklahoma Legally. The man told me it took them almost 12 years to get the whole family here. BUT they could have paid smugglers and had them all here in 2 years. They hate the illegals also. They said they give the rest of the Mexicans a bad rep.","commenter_a":"Welcome and thank you for doing it the right way","post_message":"Americas Freedom Fighters"}]
