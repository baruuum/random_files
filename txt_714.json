She had known before she moved with her husband and daughters that she woukd wake up in the house built by slaves.","commenter_a":"Reading these comments reveals why we're stuck as a nation on racial issues. There are a lot of black people who refuse to acknowledge we're no longer in 1955 and their shortcomings are primarily their own (the Obamas are not in that camp, by the way); and there are a lot of white people in stark denial of our nation's less than glorious past. And do people even read articles before they post their drivel? The First Lady was praising America for our progress, not looking down on the nation. Get a grip, people.","post_message":"Michelle Obama gave her last commencement speech as first lady at the City College of New York."},{"comment_id":"10157484651970725","commenter_b":"@username PAM she is already DESTROYING THE COUNTRY !","commenter_a":"Go trump !

She is a racist a bigot and just an unpleasant pain is n the ... Neck! Her claim to fame is that she was on Survivor and clung to an older gentleman who did everything for her and protected her.

As a parent of a special needs child, I am alarmed and sickened at her flippant discard of imperative federal laws that protect those that cannot protect themselves. Shame on you, Donald Trump, for promoting her, and shame on you, Betsy DeVos, for accepting a position for which you have zero aptitude.","commenter_a":"Once again Senator Kaine, your questioning along with others brought out that she has NO clue. Our children cannot afford to have this kind of management over their education. Scary!!","post_message":"I worry about the effects of a leader who thinks 'government sucks' on the morale of teachers. Disappointed Betsy DeVos does not support equal accountability and IDEA for all schools getting tax dollars."}]
