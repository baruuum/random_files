Take questions submitted by the public and picked randomly. Put each at a table with a mic. Turn off the mic when two minutes is up.","post_message":"It wasn’t pretty. More like a street fight than boxing, but Trump fearlessly took the game straight to Hillary and made the next 30 days about her repeated lies and corruption and not his disgusting comments of 11 years ago. He often reminded people why he won the primaries by unapologetically hitting at failed policies of the elites and establishment from both parties. Trump needed to show contrast and he did. He is more a chain saw than a scalpel, but his cuts drew blood. And it’s time to get rid of the so-called moderators. Get a big clock and let the candidates go to the stage and take turns and get rid of the media personalities who want to debate the candidates. My advice to “moderators?” If you want to debate, become a candidate. Trump won the debate. That much I know."},{"comment_id":"644967912360454","commenter_b":"That's a women? !","commenter_a":"He ain't banning a damned thing!","post_message":"A Hispanic student is banning whites from using this term... because it's racist?
