But if both had been fixed, neither would have been out by the road.","commenter_a":"Dogs are indeed wonderful. This is a sad story and an all too common story. However, as is the case in many of these sad stories, the male gets loose to chase a female that is in heat. She gets hit by a car and he refuses to leave her side , not because they were best friends or because he is a loyal friend, but rather because he is fixated on the female in heat. The moral of this sad story should be to have your dogs fixed.","post_message":"A heart-wrenching photo tells the story of a loyal dog found by his friend side Sunday morning in Dallas: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153166986805950","commenter_b":"Your lies are quite bare in the fact that Trump never said Mexicans are problem. He said ILLEGALs are problem. Legal and citizen Hispanics support him because liberals want to keep the illegals to keep wages down. Just like the South wanted to keep slaves for cheap labor. Guess who's hiring underpaid illegals for farming? California!","commenter_a":"The Anti-Defamation League is dead on. There were people with guns that stood up to the Nazis and they were wiped out with brutality. Additionally Hitler campaigned a lot like Trump promising to make Germany great again, riding into power on nationalism. Hitler sold the ubermensch and the German people bought it and you can't have superman without inferior beings to crush. European Jews were the scapegoats he needed, he pinned all German problems on them. Hitler preached that it was their fault, they were the reason Germany wasn't as great as it should be and Germans bought it. (Does that song sound familiar?) Every German could have ten guns and Hitler still would have come to power.","post_message":"Presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson Carson said that he believed \"the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\""},{"comment_id":"470896363098657","commenter_b":"That's called free speech in Obama America. Sad. I would love to see them meet their maker. Hell is going to be a busy place.","commenter_a":"They will do anything to RUB their ideas into our faces.

These are parents, children, families...not murders, drug dealers or rapists. Instead of \"building a wall\" or treating them like shit we should be coming together with Mexico so that they don't need to come here. They need help, we have a problem, so why are the two countries not putting their heads together to figure out a way to HELP","post_message":"Thousands of Central American children and families are arriving in Texas."},{"comment_id":"10153956564519087","commenter_b":"@username She is a corrupt bitch that I would never vote for president.","commenter_a":"That's the only vote that I will give Hillary.","post_message":"According to Twitter, the most retweeted tweet of the third day of the Democratic National Convention was posted by Donald J.

Hang that bitch.","commenter_a":"She is such a P.O.S. lol, if there is nothing to hide then why not release them, it's ridiculous! No one is asking for others transcripts, just her's because she is a proven liar...anyone supporting this woman needs to really see the truth and stop denying what she really is.","post_message":"During last night's debate, CNN moderator asked Hillary three times why she won't release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street banks if there's nothing that she's trying to hide from voters.
