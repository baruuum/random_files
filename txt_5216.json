They were very verbally upset with the illegals. You see their whole family was born in Mexico and they all moved to Oklahoma Legally. The man told me it took them almost 12 years to get the whole family here. BUT they could have paid smugglers and had them all here in 2 years. They hate the illegals also. They said they give the rest of the Mexicans a bad rep.","commenter_a":"Welcome and thank you for doing it the right way","post_message":"Americas Freedom Fighters"},{"comment_id":"725368590987052","commenter_b":"That bitch should get shot","commenter_a":"Leave blondie","post_message":"Share if you agree."}]
