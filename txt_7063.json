In fact she spent the last 3 months of her life in the hospital and had her nightly beer with my dad. Hopefully at some point in time they will get it figured out but sadly will probably not happen in my lifetime.","commenter_a":"That's exactly how they work. They deny, deny, deny until the person /family gives up hope. It is terrible how these people can get away with stealing/withholding money that these precious people put in and need.","post_message":"A few weeks ago, 11Alive shared the moving story of 42-year-old Melissa Kern. She had been battling ALS for almost a decade, and had reached a point where she could only move her eyelid to communicate. While she fought the disease, her husband Chris struggled to pay the bills, getting nothing from Social Security for disability benefits. Bill Liss 11Alive took on the case. They succeeded. Tragically, it was too late.

Kill them, kill their supporters, and don't stop killing until they are neutralized. Chivalrous rules of war are for opponents who will reciprocate. Virtue without reward is foolish. This is NOT a US problem. If the Muslim world objects to ISIL they have one, only one, way to show it. Kill them. That's what war is for. ISIL are winning because they have the guts and the passion (to borrow an Oriana Fallacci phrase) to stay in the fight. Their opponents lose because they are weaklings.","post_message":"\"The glories of Syria are now off-limits to Western visitors, reduced to rubble by Assad and Isil.

LOL ok.","commenter_a":"Killing for fun. \"End of the moral analysis\" The \"arguments\" of the article are pathetic. \"letâ€™s not forget that wildlife reserves can also kill lions.\" Oh, right, I had forgotten that in this world, \"I'm not the only one to do bad\" is considered an argument. I'm not a fan of any carnivorous animal, but if you decide that they're a problem, you'd better come up with solutions that are more ethical than their own actions.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"860854230637940","commenter_b":"Of course she will say that.
