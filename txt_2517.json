Let me guess, yo baby daddy is black....","commenter_a":"Its funny because in the 5th grade i refused to stand for the flag, 5th grade and i already knew this country was crap and lacked concern for its citizens. My friends grandfather was a vet from vietnam and she refused to stand for the flag out of how this country treated its troops. And she had every right and justification. You guys are missing the meaning behind the flag, you cannot just take the good of a country and claim thats all the country is. There is injustice that is constantly being negated by people like you, and those in these comments, simply because you haven't experienced it. Get over yourself and your terrible nationalistic views about a country that couldnt care less about you. Reality is reality, that flag represents a government that openly allows racism to grow and continue in our judicial and enforcement systems.","post_message":"This store owner planned a signing event with Brandon Marshall but when Marshall protested the national anthem, the owner cancelled the event immediately... but what the owner did next is going viral.
