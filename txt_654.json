Schools are not allowed to say anything regarding any matter involving a child. Before I can make an opinion on the matter would like to know the schools side on it.","commenter_a":"That's an understatement...","post_message":"The 8-year-old girl's mother says the elementary school sent her daughter home for wearing a kelly green polo shirt."},{"comment_id":"10153324235171051","commenter_b":"Since some of you females here want to crucify the father let me be the first to defend him. The child was the one that is being held, not the father. They have enough evidence to hold him and charge the kid. We don't know what kind of man the father was or what custody agreement him and the mother had. The child is the one being charge and we should leave it like that until something new comes out.","commenter_a":"Where is the father of the fetus & how far along was she? Nobody noticed the front door open on Friday or Saturday? A single mother living in that house? They said the kid had been missing a couple days as well but their news broadcast says the boy disappeared after his mothers death. What was he doing there? How did he get there? The neighbor & sister both say the boy was a good kid, good grades, non trouble maker and she was a great mother who loved & protected her family. Almost all pregnant women who die, do so at the hands of the baby's father.","post_message":"This pregnant woman was killed by the one person she trusted most in the world."},{"comment_id":"1980759552150599","commenter_b":"Or maybe he was trying to check on the deer...i'd kick the deer too if it attacked me.
