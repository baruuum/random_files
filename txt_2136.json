I do like VP Biden, and respect him, but it is obvious that the DNC establishment see Hillary as a loser now. Senator Sanders is the ONLY candidate who is fighting for ALL of WE are the 99%. The media and their Oligarch Masters are afraid of Bernie Sanders, which is why they have been ignoring him. Bernie is fighting for WE the 99% regardless of race, age, gender, sexual orientation or beliefs. He should be getting 99% of ALL votes including republicans, democrats and independents. Let's all vote for our own self interests for a CHANGE. FEEL THE BERN? Everyone had better or we are doomed.","commenter_a":"The Dem establishment can't be too pleased if Biden does decide to run.

These are Islamic extremists who believe that death in the service to their religion is the highest honor they can achieve. I'm fairly certain they've got some kind of contingency plan in place in event that their current leaders achieve \"martyrdom\". I'm just going to put that out there. \"We've killed more of their leaders\". So what? They want to die. They're promised 74 virgins in the afterlife. I'm absolutely positive there are plans in effect to appoint successors to those leaders who are destroyed.","post_message":"U.S.-led forces have killed 10 Islamic State leaders in air strikes, including individuals linked to the Paris attacks."},{"comment_id":"10153196939420047","commenter_b":"Remove yourself from The United States of America.
