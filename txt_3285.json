Congrats on taking the time to list Obamas wonderful accomplishments. I do not agree with 99% of Obama's policies and visions. Trump has the overwhelming support of people in this nation and Trump supporters are ready to make America great again. We shall begin by getting a handle on illegal immigration enforcing the Laws of this nation and doing what America does best. We are still the beacon of the free world, lets work on keeping it that way.
