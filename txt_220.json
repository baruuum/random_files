Women who do drugs while they are pregnant can cause problems for these children their entire lives. And we foot the bill for it. They should be charged, never given their kids back and the law should stop having these double standards. And if they didn't cause their kids damage then they still did the equivalent of putting a gun to its head and playing Russian roulette, which would also be child endangerment and child abuse.","commenter_a":"Does anybody find it ironic that they can be charged for exposing their unborn babies to drugs while it is legal for them to kill/abort those same babies? Either unborn babies are people with rights or they aren't. Odd how \"the law\" can have it both ways.","post_message":"Two Shoals women are charged with exposing their children to drugs.

I am voting for Trump. I voted for him in the primary's and I will vote for him at the national level if he makes the ballot. I have been a registered Republican Since GW was voted in Office. Now I can agree that Mr Donald Trump can at times speak without discernment; however it is my opinion rather my belief that he is best suited for the position given the day and age we live in.
