You obviously are another liberal idiot. Again shit for brains, criminals don't get their weapons legally. They will still get weapons illegally & then what are they going to use against an illegal weapon, throw cans of green beans & peas at them? Throw rocks at them? Why do liberal idiots refuse to understand CRIMINALS DON'T BUY WEAPONS PER SAY AT GUN SHOPS.","commenter_a":"Let's start at the very top and ban those guns that the SService are carrying all around Obama","post_message":"President Obama is taking guns out of all forms of entertainment.

THERE WILL BE MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, MORE DRUG ISSUES, MORE CRIME, MORE HOMELESSNESS, MORE TRAUMA.. THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER BUT IF THERE WAS A LIVING WAGE PUT IN PLACE WE WOULD HAVE LESS PEOPLE ON WELFARE THAT IS A GIVEN. TOO EASY..","commenter_a":"Velocity of Money: I think it's quite simple if you look at something called velocity of money. What does that mean? That is the money that gets spent back into the economy. When you have the top 1% getting money, they spend 5-10% of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend 100-110% of what they earn. Since we are a consumer economy this will be good for business in the long term. Not for the people getting the $15 per hour.","post_message":"An economist explains why Clinton‚Äôs plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 might be 'too much, too quickly.'"},{"comment_id":"10153974538694228","commenter_b":"Wow.

They just took a mother from he children who were born in this country!! We are the one's who are threatening the lives of people who trusted us and came here to make their lives better, just like Trumps mother did. Just think, if they had sent her back we wouldn't be dealing with this heartless man! What a blessing that would be.
