So many people are making lame excuses for these kids! They were old enough to be out by themselves with no supervision,THEY MADE THE DECISION to do what they did,which KILLED PEOPLE and DESTROYED HOMES !! I hope the deaths and destruction is imbedded in their minds FOREVER !!! Bad choice of a way to spend your day ya little F***ERS !!!","commenter_a":"As a child a friend and I were playing with fire in a field. We accidentally set a huge bush on fire that could have easily spread out of control had we not had a drink with us. By the grace of god it didn't spread to all the near by homes. We were not trying to burn people's homes down. I think people need to realize that kids don't always think of what could happen. They are children! They will have this on them for the rest of their lives.","post_message":"Two minors have been arrested and accused of starting wildfires that killed 14 people in eastern Tennessee."},{"comment_id":"1576897572597356","commenter_b":"The only \"racist\" in this picture is Whoopi !

Nice to see some black citizens using their fitness and strength to uphold the law. A good image for black people worldwide... Estonian immigrant eh? Well, well, I would contend it's a moot point whether or not he's 'enriched' the UK. He certainly is trying very hard to 'enrich' himself, although I think he should consider another profession to be honest... ;-)","post_message":"Police release CCTV footage showing members of the public in Leeds tackling an armed jewellery thief and pinning him until police arrived."},{"comment_id":"10153150214411320","commenter_b":"so judging by the comments...women think that it is too much, and men not far enough. :D","commenter_a":"Nothing left for the imagination","post_message":"The cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue features Hannah Davis.
