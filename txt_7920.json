Her girl, delivery was worse that the sound of a dentist drill and it was more emetic than aphrodisiac. The audience was truly stunned , as if they were witnessing the senile ego of a down and out prostitute consumed, devoured, by her own inflated ego turning tricks in the parking lot. Her exaggerated performance wreaked. It almost seemed cruel to not instantly cut to a commercial. It was truly wretched. Mr. Ed pissing on stage would have been a great improvement! And I sure that horse is dead!","post_message":"If you were left scratching your head, hereâ€™s a quick explanation."}]
