And accept this mockery of a gay marriage. All religions in the world are against gay marriage. Its unholy, unatural and discusting and a general majority agree with that. Look at how muslims treat them lol. You wanna be a fruitcake? Fine, but stop throwing your discusting life in normal ppl's faces with ur ridiculous parade of freaks and now want to step into normal familly life of husband and wife. Its not for you. Adam and Eve. Man and Woman. NOT adam and steve! Marriage is between a MAN and a WOMAN. Amen to the sister with enough conviction to stand her ground. This is just the beginning. Her stand has awakened MANY. Its about to get nasty for a few :)","commenter_a":"Kentucky Christians should march for her. Don't remain silent, be there for the sister. Amen","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10152731106111051","commenter_b":"Yet if you speak out against it, you are \"behind the times\" or \"living in the past\". We need to turn the clock back about 50 years to see what a moral society looks like and I am not just talking about the gay agenda. I am talking about adultery, divorce, teenage pregnancy, children born out of wedlock and anything else that used to be immoral that we are forced to accept today.","commenter_a":"Um, did they leave the word \"incest\" out of the story on accident??","post_message":"This girl never really knew her father â€“ until they ended up dating."},{"comment_id":"1062925700414568","commenter_b":"ruthless assholes w/$$ that want more $$ and have far right wing values!","commenter_a":"What idiot thought privatizing prisons was a good idea?
