So she could board the plane and hope she didnt get caught? That is not the time to have a disscussion about FCC rules!!! She should have a car seat with her....I hope the faa fines her for holding up the plane for over an hour..how many others passengers missed their connections.....just because she has a disability doesn't make her any more important then any other passenger. It seems like NO ONE today wants to follow rules...","commenter_a":"No one is mentioning the fact that they bought the child a seat in coach, and they were resting comfortably in first class.
