I like his energy and desire to solve problems, and he seems to be willing to change when something isn't working..unlike most politicians who refuse to admit when they're wrong. However, (and this is an example) when Hillary says he doesn't believe in climate change, he needs to back up his position with facts on why. Sure she can say scientists believe in it..well not all of them do. Trump needs to bring up scientists that don't support that theory. Also I would like to see him release his taxes, so she can't bring it up anymore.","post_message":"'CNBC, Time magazine online polls say Donald Trump won the first presidential debate' via The Washington Times."},{"comment_id":"1125870684199336","commenter_b":"If just like to see her run away!","commenter_a":"Please, NO !","post_message":"Would you like to see Michelle Obama run for office one day?"},{"comment_id":"771242182992562","commenter_b":"A couple of missals would take care of this problem.","commenter_a":"Hey where are the nasty sharks when you need them?","post_message":"Let's get rid of these scum bags already! @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153472925796336","commenter_b":"Oh, what a surprise, Jackie is an ignorant b*tch offering her uninformed, sexist opinion.","commenter_a":"Everyone is so concerned with making sure winny people feelings don't get hurt by legalizing gay marriage and taking down flags but the real important stuff like the murder of baby's everyday is last on their agenda.. ban abortion and all these little hoes will be forced to used condoms. .
