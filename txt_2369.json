Women don't come back in body bags during our wars. To go on a currency bill as Washington, Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson, Grant, Franklin, and Jefferson have is b/c of their committment to this country, AND NOT b/c of their genitals.

Christina Booth, who is believed to be suffering from postpartum depression, made a 911 call Saturday sobbing and screaming at the operator that her children would not stop crying. When police arrived they found the twins on the couch crying \"uncontrollably\" and \"bleeding from their necks.\" The 2-year-old was upstairs with a similar wound. All three survived their injuries. Booth allegedly told police \"she knew if she killed all the kids the house would be quiet\" for her husband \"who gets annoyed when the children cry.\" Read KTLA's story here: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153604606804024","commenter_b":"AFUCKINMEN ON THAT SHIT!","commenter_a":"OBAMA DOES NOT CARE---HE TREATS THE ENEMY BETTER THEN AMERICANS !!!!!!","post_message":"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Patriots Who Dare...

Donny Trump and his lackeys DO NOT get to redefine what a conservative is. Many many real conservatives have fought hard, long battles over the decades to pull this nation back onto the constitutional rails advocating for founding principles. This fight has always been against politicians of the democrat party and republican establishment put there in part with Donny Trump donations. Where was Donny when some were standing tall against amnesty? Where was Donny when some were fighting Obamacare? Where was Donny when some were fighting to get Planned Parenthood defunded? Where was Donny when a certain someone was fighting the unconstitutional DC gun ban?
