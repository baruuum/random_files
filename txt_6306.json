Those kid's were way out of bounds for doing that. But I assure you, no citizens of the United States of America are being threatened of being deported. Only illegal immigrants of any color, race or religion. Its already the law. It has been for a long time. Its just not been enforced properly. The media tries to spend it in to hate. Its not hate, although there is anger for what were allowing to happen to our country. I personally only hate terrorist. No matter where they come from. Thats why we need to band together all American citizens. We have band together against a corrupt government, illegal immigration and these terrorists. Foreign and demestic. If we can't come to terms with that as a people. See it for what it is. Than im afaid all is lost.","commenter_a":"No they don't. You continue to try and make it about Trump. It does however have a lot to do with you. The media and the government. This is your( collectively) propaganda. To continue to divide. Its not working. Not for the majority. People listen please.

Oh, and his favorite adviser - himself, his biggest fan - himself, his biggest fan - himself. Who else does he need? He's been saying all along that he will win without support. The truth is that, as much as I dislike these guys, they are basing this on principles. Laura, I used to have much more trust in you, but you've gone over too the dark side it seems. Trump is the worst candidate in my lifetime. And when you consider that includes Dole, McCain, Romney and the Bushes, that's saying a lot.","post_message":"Jeb Bush, John Kasich and company reveal they value their egos more than the GOP's success."}]
