The only money that gets printed is money that gets destroyed that banks send back. We are not in debt because we keep printing our own money. We can only print as much money as we have in our gold reserves. The reason we are in debt is because we keep borrowing money from places like China. But see that's the problem with the people in this country, they run to the polls to vote but have no clue how anything even operates","commenter_a":"Trump won't be any better. We will have more wars and more debt. Your pensions and other government ensured money will be gambled away again. The dollar will continue to devalue as the Fed prints money debt money. More American jobs will go overseas to China and Mexico. The middle class will slowly but surely wither away while people wonder what happened AGAIN and do absolutely nothing but complain on the couch or internet. The list goes on and on and on but you reap what you sew I guess. It is always the younger generation who has to clean up the mess of the old as always.","post_message":"Donald J.
