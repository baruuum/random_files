I believe in self protection but, I don't blame her for wanting to block this and I do blame him for his assault on her.

Most of the genetic information is on the X chromosome and women have 2 Xs, men only one X. The Y chromosome has little genetic information, besides the male sex gene. Consequently, women are genetically stronger in many way ways and live longer. In many European countries women do a lot of the heavy work in the fields. In the US women are treated as somehow inferior, and men want to believe that they are \"weaker,\" but it is not necessarily so.","post_message":"This Republican misogynist is fuming that these two women passed the same Army Ranger course he did."},{"comment_id":"10152934156123067","commenter_b":"Molested.
