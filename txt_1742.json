We need commonsense gun control ASAP. We need to vote out all politicians that oppose commonsense gun reform and get this issue addressed","commenter_a":"The cop is clearly nervous as hell. His voice is cracking and his gun is shaking terribly. To me, this is proof cops just aren't trained enough to identify true threats and staying calm under extreme pressures.
