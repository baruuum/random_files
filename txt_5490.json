It takes the 1% to contribute the 99% of us that couldn't keep the economy a float without there financial support or contributions to the economy. What is ruining our economy is supporters like yourselves who probably believe in giving the minorities a place to stand in the bread line while they send there un-taxed & undocumented earnings home to there families living like royalty on the backs of the mighty American dollar. While the rest of registered documented citizens pay our taxes to make America great.

It teaches students how to comprehend math rather than just memorizing tables. It also teaches students different ways to do math in their heads. I love the \"its dumbing down students\" argument. You, as an adult, cant do it or unferstand, your child can... yet this is making THEM dumber? Sounds to me like its an ego thing. How about you sit there and learn with your child instead of just complaining about it. Take the time to try to actually understand what your child is learning. Why would any parent not want their child to be smarter than they are... why would any parent argue and complain about something that will make their child smarter simply because the parent isnt smart enough to understand it. I have a High School education, no college degree, and i can still understand common core math. Why cant ...","commenter_a":"I love how people bash Common Core without ANY understanding of it at all.
