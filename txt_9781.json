The Media, Hollywood, Academia, Celebrities and the Elected Officials on both sides that have tainted and divided our country with their slanted, elitist opinions have finally been put in their place. This election was never about Donald Trump, it was about the people. Not the people the media falsely reported about and stereotyped. I was at two Trump rallies, these people were black, white, Hispanic, all ages and all races. People who love our country, love our constitution and the principles within it, love God and love and respect all Americans. The silent majority who we're sick and tired of being falsely portrayed as the intolerant ones, being intimidated, called names and told by an arrogant and grossly out of control government and out of touch minority what we were supposed to think, say and do. #WeThePeople #IndependenceDay2016","commenter_a":"This is about Obama, the establishment and MSM picking Clinton over Bernie.

It seems highly suspect to punish people who do their job but allow those who are unable to complete their primary assigned task to continue to be paid. Again, politics over people.

No I am not in favor of our politics right now and feel that neither are a good choice for the US. But that aside do we not have more important things to worry about then what a speech writer gave to the wife of a running mate? Move on and let's get things going in a better place for our country, with so many loosing their lives recently I feel this is a low priority. Let's make change for good elect Mickey Mouse.
