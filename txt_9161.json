Our high levels of foreign aid and international development is only the beginning. We need to stop bombing other peoples countries and begin accepting a LOT more refugees. ------------------------------------- \"Voting yourself out of the EU has not solved that problem at all and it will most certainly not lead to more non-EU migration\" But with control of our own borders we can stop priority status for Europeans over non-Europeans and decide our immigration policies at election time. ------------------------------------- \"And if you are so concerned by population control on your island\" I'm concerned about population control on earth.

Out of all the things she could have been doing, or should have been doing - THIS is what she chooses. It's pretty unreal to think that some people actually want her to become the next POTUS...

I'd put a spot light on the Obamas for not treating the dog properly and training their girls on how to treat the dog. Dogs don't lash out just like that.
