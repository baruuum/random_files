When the California primary happens I'm voting for Bernie. But if Hilary does win the democratic side I'll vote for her. No way am I letting a republican be president. Republicans will just do what they can to get rid of Obamacare, canceling out the rights for the LGBT community, sending our troops to meaningless wars. Hilary might go to war but however she might not. In the end I'm voting democrat for the presidency. A republican will just destroy this country and send us to hell. Not voting for democrat cause Hilary is it is voting for a republican.","post_message":"BREAKING â€“"}]
