More like a street fight than boxing, but Trump fearlessly took the game straight to Hillary and made the next 30 days about her repeated lies and corruption and not his disgusting comments of 11 years ago. He often reminded people why he won the primaries by unapologetically hitting at failed policies of the elites and establishment from both parties. Trump needed to show contrast and he did. He is more a chain saw than a scalpel, but his cuts drew blood. And it‚Äôs time to get rid of the so-called moderators. Get a big clock and let the candidates go to the stage and take turns and get rid of the media personalities who want to debate the candidates. My advice to ‚Äúmoderators?‚Äù If you want to debate, become a candidate. Trump won the debate. That much I know."},{"comment_id":"10153129778526336","commenter_b":"Women can't do it. Its physically impossible unless the standards are lowered (this has been repeatedly proven in Marine infantry officer course) and lower standards WILL KILL PEOPLE IN COMBAT. People that want women in ground combat either have not the slightest idea what it is OR had a far different experience than most infantrymen of my generation had. There are no bathrooms in the field. There are no showers for weeks or months sometimes. But maybe its easier now. But I doubt SF or Seals are.","commenter_a":"Everybody should be held to the same physical standards to do the job. Man or woman.
