Being a hairdresser I did lots of H/cuts on men. They wanted every hair on their head to be Perfect. It really bothered me when so many men came in the salon just to wait until the H/C was finished. They would bring young girls with them, who could interpret the English language. It was so hard for the young girls to be put in the middle to speak for them & me. This should be a wake up call due to illegal immigrants.","commenter_a":"We all know this!!!","post_message":"This frustrated sheriff just sent a huge message to America that perfectly sums up Donald J.

I'm sure if Kim's paycheck was affected by how many licenses she issued then her religious beliefs would't be as important.","commenter_a":"Hey, wait a minute.....where's the outrage towards the Muslim bakeries (several) who refused service to gay couples planning weddings because of their religious beliefs? And why did the Muslim Target store cashier get an allowance to her job description to specify items she refused to ring up for a customer when they wanted to purchase a bottle of wine? And why did the Muslim flight attendant (<----surreal, isn't it?) get a religious liberty allowance to her job description by refusing to serve alcohol to a passenger? Yeah, okay. Had Kim been a Muslim, this narrative would have flipped to sympathize on the side of religious liberty. But she's not Muslim. She's just a Christian adhering to her religious rights, and in a respectful way, might I add. Respectful. Take a page, all you vulgar-mouthed, whiny, double standard hypocrites. It is what it is: religious liberty. Further, as stated in the ...","post_message":"The letters from Kim Davis that were just uncovered could drastically change how people think about this case.

Wake up people, he is setting you up, playing you like a fiddle for his own political agenda. What a low life to use the children over and over. Not one damn thing he is going to use that damn pen for, will stop the issues we have. The gun doesn't pull its own trigger and mentally ill, terrorists, and murderers do not obey damn laws. He wants to disarm the law abiding. Ask him to dismiss the secret service that carry guns to protect his ass and see how far you get.","post_message":"“Every time I think about those kids [in Newtown], it gets me mad,” President Barack Obama said as tears rolled down his cheek.
