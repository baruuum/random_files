Many of these mandates and taxes have resulted in fewer jobs, lower incomes, and poor quality healthcare for some of our country's neediest families. Additionally, H.R. 3762 provides States with grants to be used towards eradicating substance abuse and supporting public and mental health programs. I support Speaker Ryan’s plan to present a Republican alternative to this misguided law, and commend his continued leadership to put Americans first.

Now President Trump needs to follow suit. He should stand up to the Chamber of Commerce — and the armies of lawyers and lobbyists that brought this frivolous lawsuit — and allow the rule to be implemented in April as planned. Hardworking Americans saving for their retirement deserve to have a retirement adviser who is recommending the investments that are the best for their retirement security, not the ones that let advisers pocket kickbacks and prizes."

However because the goods from Mexico are no longer competitive other countries can raise their price some.

After Governor Walker won an election promising to accept the federal funds, hospitals have had a more profitable year due to less uncompensated care. That will hold down costs for everyone.

Generous tax credits allowed me to buy good insurance for a fair price. Blue Cross offers the best network in Alaska, far better than any fly by night across state lines policy.

Don’t let the name fool you; this regulation does nothing to protect waterways. Instead, it’s an attempt to end the coal mining operations that employ so many Hoosiers, and sustain our communities. That’s why I support a resolution in the United States Senate to overturn job-killing coal regulation before it does serious damage to Indiana’s economy. The coal rule would effectively lock-up to half of the nation’s coal supply below ground, and thus destroy as many as a third of America’s coal mining jobs.

He is more interested in the radical registration and confiscation of weapons from law-abiding Americans than the elimination of radical Islam. The Obama Administration's policies have only weakened America's reputation worldwide and emboldened ISIS. I don't know why this President can't say, \"They are our enemy. We are going to eradicate them before they have the opportunity to keep killing us.\" We must stand up to radical Islamic terrorism before another American life is lost, and President Obama is clearly not up to the job."

It is likely that this is the spirituality origin of dreadlocks in Indian culture. However, the first archeological proof of people wearing dreadlocks came from Egypt where mummies have been recovered with their dreadlocks still in tact. Regardless of their origin, dreadlocks have been worn by nearly every culture at some point in time or another. Roman accounts stated that the Celts wore their hair ‘like snakes’. The Germanic tribes and Vikings were also known to wear their hair in dreadlocks. Dreadlocks have been worn by the monks of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Nazarites of ...",

We have none of those factors in our favor in Syria today. We have a long, proud history of accepting refugees facing danger and persecution. Up till now, the small number of Syrians allowed in the country has enabled us to take prudent measures to screen them.

Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully and fairly enforce the law. Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have. There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly and clearly: This is just the beginning. If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while Donald Trump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us. If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism, and bigotry into the Justice Department, he'll hear from all of us. And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into the Justice Department ..."

The ruling or fatwa has the force of law and appears to go beyond the Islamic State's previous known utterances on the subject, a leading Islamic State scholar said.

Will the world ever have peace with Ishmael? Will Ishmael even find peace himself? Deep down, don’t we all want the same things (love, peace, acceptance)? I wonder how much longer we will have to wait before real peace comes to humanity. Gen 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou [art] with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. Gen 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.",

If someone is invading your space then ask them to move. Male or female. Being an empowered person is using your voice instead of letting people make you feel powerless. I love how it's ok for women to tell all these men to disregard their \"balls\" and just sit uncomfortably anyway. If a man was doing that to us we would rip them to shreds. Can't have it both ways ladies. @username , find a journalist that's more worthy of what you stand for. This is a waste of time!!",

If you can dock or anchor a 10,000 ton warship under extreme stress, you can do the same thing for a small commercial ship. We spend hundreds of millions to train our servicemembers to do highly skilled jobs, and they are the best at what they do. But too many still struggle to transition into civilian jobs because they don't have the right certifications and licenses – even when they’re being hired to do the exact same thing under much less taxing conditions. We've made progress on this issue over the last few years, and I don’t want to lower civilian standards – but I don’t believe for one second that these individuals aren’t ready to do the equivalent civilian jobs the day ..."

Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.

I encourage my colleagues to continue to fight to defund this organization that places more value on the sale price of babies' body parts than it does on the sanctity of human life. We should not rest until we have done everything in our power to protect the life of unborn children. Ensuring no additional federal dollars go to the abortion industry or Planned Parenthood is a good place to start. This is why it ..."
