Doesnt matter if your black, white, asian or blue, these families live a life that involves violence, or may have experienced violence, try to take precautions to keep family safe but are ignorant to what \"safe\" really means. DPD can only do so much, with stupid people. Another tragedy, that will soon be replaced by another, unfortunately, probably by tomorrow evening.
