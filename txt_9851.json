The Democrats sold that clean coal fantasy for years, and Clinton is still trying to sell it. Heck, she said natural gas is a \"bridge fuel\" when, renewable can replace most energy needs. When a candidate who sold fracking to the world, and supports \"clean coal\" gets environmental group endorcements. That candidate is the establishment. Because nothing else makes any damn sense.","post_message":"Safe fracking is like clean coal, pure fiction. Fracking pollutes water, degrades air quality and worsens climate change. No amount of regulation can make it safe."},{"comment_id":"10153961752341037","commenter_b":"Duh, obamacare is funded by government (taxpayer dollars)","commenter_a":"If obamacare is so great, why is it that the clintons & sanders are not enrolled in it?","post_message":"Bernie Sanders airbrushed the complexities of trying to overhaul health care all over again and Hillary Clinton offered a selective reading of her rival's record on gun control in the latest Democratic presidential debate."},{"comment_id":"954073617997796","commenter_b":"Hate speech.
