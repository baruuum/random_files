Since there isn't much talent there.","commenter_a":"Sure, Sarah made Tina famous and rich. But Tina helped do the same for Sarah. I believe Sarah is laughing all the way to the bank....just as much as Tina is. Sarah did look a bit disjointed at the endorsement and Tina jumped on the opportunity to mock her. But Tina....sorry. You failed miserably. Didn't laugh at all. SNL is just sad. Don't watch any longer. The constant right bashing is boring and predictable.","post_message":"You saw this, right?"},{"comment_id":"10154615218080530","commenter_b":"@username-Fequiere Wait, so now black on black violence is due to INEQUALITY????","commenter_a":"When are people going to start protesting the deaths of 9 year old girls executed in Gang warfare in Chicago? It's like we're protesting something that happens 1 time out of 1,000,000. And nobody cares about something that happens like everyday. The media has got the people riled up about a very small issue while ignoring major problems. That's why I don't understand this movement. It's like if the government was repossessing everyone's home and moving them to refugee camps for no reason, but I was protesting the governments estate tax while ignoring people's homes being taken.","post_message":"Does the Michigan Football players' silent protest make you uncomfortable?
