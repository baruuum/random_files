They are deplorable.","commenter_a":"I am a Hillary supporter but instead of casting blame she should've been a better candidate. She should've visited more cities and counties and not just the ones that she thought would've secured her the election. She shouldn't have insulted the American people and expect that they were going to magically convert to her side by debating Trump. Yes, the FBI director and the emails definitely contributed towards her loss but maybe if she didn't have major corporations and banks and foreign countries on her payroll she would've won. Edit: To everybody saying that I'm not a real Hillary supporter or that I'm a troll/not a real person. I voted for Hillary so if that doesn't show my support then I don't know what will. Because just like you can love/support your children/parents but not agree with some of their beliefs or with some of the things they do, you ...","post_message":"Breaking News: Hillary Clinton cast blame for her loss on a decision by James Comey, the FBI chief, to revive an email inquiry ahead of the election."},{"comment_id":"914820658566958","commenter_b":"Let Syrian refugees move in with her!

I can‚Äôt predict the future but let‚Äôs take a hypothetical in which Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. Let‚Äôs take it one step further and say for this narrative that he runs against Hillary Clinton. I think the race to be POTUS will be close, and irrespective of who wins, can you imagine of what Donald Trump is going to do with all the dirt on Hillary Clinton. She and her husband amassed a 200 million dollar fortune while in political office. If they both worked their entire lives for the government, they couldn‚Äôt make that kind of money, let alone have it in the bank. That didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. She got a $650,000 for a 45 minute speech from a ‚Äúbank,‚Äù but swears she will kick their butts to the curb (yeah right). Her email server was used ...","post_message":"Nearly 8,000 people are expected to gather at the Convention Center when Donald Trump makes his way to Hartford tonight. @webpagelink"}]
