Can't have someone like that as attorney general. He might actually enforce the law.","commenter_a":"She knows the rules. . She was warned. . She broke the rule. . She was disciplined. .

CNN CNBC and the rest of the liberal media wish to turn this debate unto a boxing rim once again. At the end, it will hurt the Republicans and that is the liberal media's purpose. They intend to make you fight Trump. They want to bring you down, the liberal media though. DO NOT FALL INTO THEIR TRAP!!!!!","post_message":"Thank you for all the kind words of encouragement leading up to the debate tonight.
