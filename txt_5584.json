In every state and city. Our second amendment has been a shield for evil doers. Most criminals and thugs or gangs are trying to survive a life of under privilege and zero opportunities...jmo","commenter_a":"I live in the Atlanta area and every day, I say again, every day there are 3, 5 and some days more murders, carjackings, home invasions, bank robberies all committed by thugs, gangs and criminals. Yet, you don't hear one word, not one word of anger or control to get the guns out of the hands of these criminals. There are more murders in one week in the Atlanta area than the 10 souls that were lost in Oregon. If politicians really cared about every life, there would be more done to dismantle the gangs and thugs in our country. But instead all they care about is how they can take advantage and politicize a senseless crime to advance their agenda to take guns away from US citizens. They know that CRIMINALS DON\"T CARE ABOUT THEIR F'n LAWS!!!! So their true intentions must be to disarm the people.","post_message":"POLITICO takes a look back at some of his stronger words on the issue."}]
