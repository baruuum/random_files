Anyone petitioning for the removal of Wonder Woman as ambassador, clearly doesn't know the history of the character. Peace Justice Equality ...and more. Bottom line: basing her removal mainly on appearance - is sexist. Look at male superhero costumes. They leave little to the imagination also. No one is hollering about that. As a feminist, I understand that the sexual objectification of women is a huge problem in our culture. The answer is not to force women to cover up. The answer is to allow women to express themselves without fear. The answer is to teach our boys how to behave. Read the comics. Read the history of the character. Read scholarly articles on WW as a feminist icon. She has pro-women zingers that make me cheer! Many parts of her \"sexy\" costume are actually powerful symbols. Do some research. I know there are more important ...","post_message":"Wonder Woman has been stripped of her role as UN honorary ambassador less than two months after the appointment was made."},{"comment_id":"10153359529326051","commenter_b":"I would have beat her ignorant ass with a stick too.

I am a larger sized woman and have done the same thing when I found clothes that were super large. It's not a slight to those who are larger than me and I'm sure it wasn't meant that way by this girl. If you are that sensitive by your size, then stay at home or do something about it. I have been called names my whole life because I'm not a size 2 or even a size 12. What others think of my size is none of my business. If they allow my \"size\" determine whether they want to know me or not, I don't care. It's their loss. I'm pretty freakin' awesome once you get to know me. I like me. I'm confident in who I am on the ...","post_message":"A photographer is getting a lot of attention after a picture in a dressing room went viral."}]
