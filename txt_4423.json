Trump over and over...he should be so embarrassed but he's an idiot so I guess we are still to assume he's above and better than the rest of us. By the way Obama - no one was laughing other than \"AT\" you for being so ignorant. That got you no leverage with anyone in that room if those people attending were normal human beings - only your planted people gave you any recognition and even they must have been devastated by your horribly degrading remarks all made in the name of humor - just as Will Farrell finds Alzheimers disease comedy - this was right up there with it...SHAME ON YOU FOR BEING SUCH AN ASS HOLE!!!","post_message":"PHOTOS and VIDEO of TRUMP RALLY IN CALIFORNIA...
