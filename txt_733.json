They have made the world what it is today. I raise my glass to you gents. I've even made you a sandwich. But on the flip side of these strapping, rugged men there's you. A Bernie Sanders sycophant with not quite enough self-worth to fill an egg cup. Or a teaspoon. Certainly not enough to fill your bong. Take a good long puff before you read the rest of this, it's not going to get any better. I'm not going to make you a sandwich either. May I recommend a Hot Pocket? What is a man?

I commend the Pittsburg community for rejecting this decision and I stand with them. The Constitution guarantees a right to freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. This banner is not only an expression of faith, but of love for country. Expressions of patriotism, faith, and community should be welcome in our society and I have contacted USPS officials to express my concerns about their decision and to request their reconsideration. If the local post office branch is unwilling to display the banner, then I would be proud to hang it at my own office in Pittsburg."},{"comment_id":"674562089401036","commenter_b":"The asshole cant do it","commenter_a":"Yes because the jails are full of Muslims.
