And take a long, hard look at themselves. A) she's a CHILD B) she's going to go further in life than any of you small-minded simpletons because of her drive and determination, and her GPA and scholarships were a direct result of that. She didn't show up on free Yale day. She is smart, worked her butt off, and is on track for the kind of success she deserves.","post_message":"Larissa Martinez held a 4.95 GPA and took 17 AP classes over her McKinney Boyd High School career. She's also an undocumented immigrant who arrived in the U.S. in 2010 -- but only 10 of her classmates knew that before last week. After her speech, they gave her a standing ovation."},{"comment_id":"995263523875544","commenter_b":"And u look like what came out of my anus this morning, except not as attractive...","commenter_a":"Her face looks like the whole butt!","post_message":"Rosie Oâ€™Donnell unloads on Donald Trump..."},{"comment_id":"10155070444570603","commenter_b":"This disease is curable with treatment.

I know the tough talk is to \"just send them all back\" but those aren't plans. Sure wish yall had answers to problems instead of continuing this political theatre.","post_message":"Last night, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that effectively blocks President Obama's unilateral executive actions on immigration. The magnitude of the President's executive overreach on immigration cannot be ignored. The House passed legislation to stop the President's unlawful plan, but Senate Democrats will not even allow it to be debated. It is my sincere hope that Senate Democrats see this legal action as a wakeup call and let the House bill be considered in the Senate."}]
