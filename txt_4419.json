Shane Those that are better informed than you are agreeing on this, big time, using measurements, not belief. You can't use your logic&belief on things that have happened over millions of years with this, that has happened over a range of 50 years. Keep reading up on this because you're getting very close.","commenter_a":"While I won't support any of Donald's nominations, I think climate change has always been around, long long before humans. And much longer still before the industrial era. The earth has been a waste land before, and it's also been a water world. I don't know why it's impossible to believe it will happen again.","post_message":"I will vote NO on the nominations of Scott Pruitt to be EPA Administrator and Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy. The scientific community is virtually unanimous. Climate change is real, it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world. We need an EPA Administrator and a Secretary of Energy who are prepared to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and their short term profits, and lead the fight to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. In discussing these issues with Mr. Pruitt and Mr. Perry I found no evidence to believe that they are prepared to do that."},{"comment_id":"10153055349059170","commenter_b":"Nah he's not Indian.
