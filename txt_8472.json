In the 1940's, many Japanese were US citizens, and living here already. Their internment was a knee-jerk reaction to a very real fear that the Empire would try to invade our country with help from loyalists living here. Today, there is no nation threatening invasion, but rather a rogue terror group looking to radicalize ideological adherents within our borders, and inspire them to randomly murder us. Trump has suggested that we not allow any more people from Middle Eastern areas known as incubators for terrorists UNTIL we have much better means of sorting out the radicals from the legitimate refugees.","post_message":"This is one of the most powerful segments we've ever seen. Tom Brokaw compares Donald Trump's call to bar Muslims from America to Japanese internment, Nazi Germany, McCarthyism, and Jim Crow - and he didn't stop there. This amazing video is well worth taking a moment to watch, via NBC News"}]
