Women don't need your approval, your acceptance, or your opinion. Do you expect women you've never met to weigh in on your private medical decisions? Of course not! Stop being so arrogant. What isn't acceptable is your flawed thinking that you can control a woman. You can only control yourself.","commenter_a":"\"Birth control\" is a misnomer. If one thinks about it, it signifies controlling an already conceived being. Therefore, i do not embrace birth control. Like stopping birth. I do embrace control prior to the embryo attaching itself to the wall of the uterus. We need to find a name for that.","post_message":"How you REALLY stop unintended pregnancies."},{"comment_id":"10150971534884999","commenter_b":"The thrust for stories to prove a Trump presidency will embolden bigots is so great right now, people are faking hate crimes.","commenter_a":"\"RISE IN HATE CRIMES\" -If 'Murican media is anything like Toronto's , they are rigorously hunting down stories that fit the appropriate narrative of the day.","post_message":"Kids are at risk of getting the message that racism and harassment are OK, Emily Bazelon writes in The New York Times Opinion Section."},{"comment_id":"1001556806534263","commenter_b":"A vagina is a sex organ.
