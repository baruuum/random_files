And I think we're gonna see levels of violence that we have not seen."},{"comment_id":"1391127634238463","commenter_b":"You poor Republicans. You are so lost in your stupor that all you can do is harp again and again over Hillary's e-mails. Sure, it was a mistake. But in the final analysis you can not find any harm caused by that. In the mean time just consider the damage caused to our nation by the rigidity caused by the Republican Congress over the past eight years. Your solution is to nominate a man devoid of any moral compass. Thanks Republicans. I can only hope that what rises from the ashes of the Grand Old Party will come closer to Abe's vision and that Rush L. stays buried in the ashes.","commenter_a":"I just do not understand how any true red blooded America could even think about voting for Hillary after her cover up of Benghazi and Emails !! The only thing she has proven is she is a BIG lair and above the law ! She is truly a woman of zero integrity and belongs in prison NOT running for our president !","post_message":"\"It took the socialist to remind us that you supported the trade agreements that cost millions of American jobs and millions of dollars.\" Last night on \"Justice,\" Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed Hillary Clinton over her Wall Street ties, failure to help the Middle Class, and backtracking over her husband's crime bill. @webpagelink"}]
