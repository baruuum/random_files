He would've been painted an insider since government is all he knows. They planned to trot out his rape fantasy story as well. Also, Vermont tried and failed it's statewide Healthcare for all system.

If you look at the Gallup survey in March of 2015, 50 percent of Americans had a favorable impression of Clinton, only 39 percent an unfavorable one. So there was clearly no deep reservoir of Clinton hatred among the general public at the time. On the contrary: Americans liked her; they liked her quite a bit.
