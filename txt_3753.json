If Cruz is the best this nation can do, we are done. We don't need pontificating, and pandering to Christian values. We need leadership, a complete change in course to get our government working for the people again. I don't see it happening. Cruz belongs at a shatuaqwa tent, not the Oval Office. He cost us 24 billion in a phony shut down, could care less about health care for the middle class or poor, voted against Veterans benefits increases and VA spending. He's a charlatan, and the Elmer Gantry of the GOP.","post_message":"Ted Cruz killed it at the conference of social conservatives. And Marco Rubio fell flat."}]
