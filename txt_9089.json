Maybe the punchline is exactly what I wrote.","commenter_a":"What does this photo actually say? It says girls are annoying. Girls talk too much. Girls should be seen and not heard. Whatever a girl says is not important. Men do not want to hear what a girl has to say. Little boys have a voice but little girls do not. The husband's voice is more important than his wife's. Seriously? I can't even imagine what kind of \"joke\" they were trying to tell with this photo. This is hardly funny at all. It's not that this is necessarily offensive, it's just frickin' sad, ignorant, and misogynistic. Congratulations to this mother and father...they have essentially taught their daughters a very important lesson as to their place in this world...and that they have NO VOICE!","post_message":"A firestorm of controversy has erupted over a viral Christmas card depicting a man's wife and girls with mouths taped shut..."},{"comment_id":"10154303703286178","commenter_b":"You sound like a feminist bro.","commenter_a":"So does this mean only woman can understand how to run a home ?
