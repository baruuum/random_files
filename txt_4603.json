Over 21,000 of you have sent your \"Stop Lynch\" Emergency Fax Petition through Facebook -- and your voice is being heard loud and clear. Momentum is building against her confirmation thanks to your outpouring of opposition. In fact, two previously undecided Republicans announced their intention to vote against her nomination. But you and I can't stop now. As you know, Loretta Lynch has proven herself to be an advocate for the lawless conduct of the Obama administration and not an advocate for the rule of law. That's why I'm counting on you to keep the pressure on and urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on her confirmation. Sign your \"Stop Lynch\" petition right away!"}]
