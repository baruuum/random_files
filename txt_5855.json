Get off the computer and go talk to the young men whose lives were destroyed. Go peer at those missing eyes. Go stand near the them who lost legs. Listen to the stories of the PTSD stricken. Then come speak this hunger for war. I took an oath to support and defend this constitution. I have great pride when I see little American children stumble to daycare with their backpacks on. I also know, the threat to us doesn't lie in a desert. No donkeys can cross the ocean alive. It's in the profiteers. Those folk who rattle dangers but are too old to pick up arms. Defending our country has been my lifelong business, but I won't say it's been without questioning where the profit is going! Re-read Sodom and Gomorrah. It wasn't about being gay...it was about PRIDE and INHOSPITALITY both of which ...","commenter_a":"You all should do a little research on Trump, did you know that when his father died Trump stole his brother's inheritance and did not get anything to his brothers kids either. He is a greedy bastard. The pathetic part of all of this is that this ignorant population who is supporting him right now think that he is going to do more for them. He doesn't give a rats ass about any of them at all whatsoever. He would structure tax laws and policies that would for their benefit him once he left the White House if he ever made it to presidency.
