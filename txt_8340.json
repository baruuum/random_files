If you raise minimum wage to the argued $15 an hour, you would have to raise everyone else's wages the same percentage. Now that it costs more to pay workers, manufacturers now have to increase retail prices to make up the difference. This achieves nothing and you're back to square one. You get paid more, but products cost more. 1 to 1 is the same ratio as 4 to 4. Paying more money for the same exact thing is the precise definition of inflation. This mind set is why recessions exist in the countries that follow this policy.","post_message":"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America.
