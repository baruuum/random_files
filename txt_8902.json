Since we can't ever achieve \"the look\" that we see in ads, we are consistently striving it, and so continue to buy more cosmetics than we need. Pictures and articles like this are absolutely necessary if women are to ever claim their power as more than objects.","commenter_a":"News Flash! Most of us know what people look like in real life.

It's not the gun it's the person that picks up the gun that is the problem. If you would allow gun safety in the schools, like sex-ed, there would be a lowering in accidental shootings.","post_message":"While Everytown's ad message is all about being and safe with guns, the ad, amazingly, disregards basic fundamentals of safe gun handling.

If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten! When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Y Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno husband Bill described her selection as worst mistake. Some may not ...","post_message":"Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton just revealed that she believes Americans have too many guns in their homes, and I don't think one would have to take too wild of a guess as to what she would do about it if elected president...
