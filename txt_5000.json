Not being sarcastic, it's a real question. This meme seems misleading. By the way, I think ALL women should be allowed to choose, and I think people who don't want kids shouldn't have them. However, everything I've ever read suggests this isn't an option for Muslim women (as well as in some other religions). Would like input on the realities.","post_message":"\"Don't get me wrong, I love children - just as long as they aren't mine\" #100Women"},{"comment_id":"754375298024849","commenter_b":"I thought you did well..
