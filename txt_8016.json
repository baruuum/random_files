Most of the MASS SHOOTERS have been Mentally Challenged. You ask why are they allowed to roam the streets? Well, they took the money to contain and treat them and gave to to the unwed mother to have 20 kids with and to provide Food Stamps. DO NOT under estimate the challenged ones. Some are very smart and great at solving problems. They just can't function in society.","commenter_a":"Here's what we now so far: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik met in Saudi Arabia. Farook was described as a devoutly religious Muslim (most likely Sunni). The third suspect, Tayyeep Bin Ardogan, is a 28-year-old native of Qatar. Only Farook was employed by the agency hosting the Christmas party. Multiple explosive devices were discovered at the scene of the massacre. IEDs (improvised explosive devices) are illegal in the State of California. IEDs take time to build. Obviously, there was some planning involved. IEDs are mass-casualty weapons that kill indiscriminately. They're not something you use when you're concerned about casualty mitigation and innocent bystanders. A coworker stated that Farook had grown out his beard over the last several months. The geniuses in the DOJ (namely the FBI) are trying to ascertain a motive. That's nice. Let's see how long it takes them to put the pieces together.","post_message":"The suspects in the San Bernardino shooting were armed with four guns and an explosive device in a \"well-planned\" attack, officials said."},{"comment_id":"10154303024133132","commenter_b":"Shut up, Maggie.","commenter_a":"It's not nice to be wearing such nice clothes to cuba when those people have nothing!
