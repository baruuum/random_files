Not because it was offensive or anything, but because it seemed to take what is clearly an issue (people taking up too much space on the subway) that can be caused by *both genders* (not just men) and acted like men were silly for thinking the ads were sexist by only targeting men. How much outrage would there be if there were a series of ads specifically targeting women for doing something that both men and women could do? Food for thought.","post_message":"\"Occupying all the territory you can is sexy.
