Building a wall will do absolutely nothing for illegal immigration and drug trafficking other than to satisfy the small minority of Americans who voted for Trump. The tax payers will have dole out billions to build this \"wall\" without benefit. You can't even call this a viable \"infrastructure\" project. I do agree with deporting illegal criminal offenders and would go even further by deporting criminals with legal but non-permanent status. Not only from Mexico but anywhere. Ireland, Israel, Africa, etc...","commenter_a":"Isolationism does have consequences.","post_message":"This afternoon, President Donald J.

They are a whole level of crazy I don't want to be around. Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other!

Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was \"stronger together, peace, love, equality\"......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters. Your example is clear.","post_message":"Protesters burned American flags and chanted \"not my president\" despite Democrats' calls for a peaceful transition of power."},{"comment_id":"10153141603253352","commenter_b":"Melissa shut the fuck up!","commenter_a":"Those Black Companies are NOT affiliated with ANY Black Supremacy Groups that's the BIG DAMN DIFFERENCE.
