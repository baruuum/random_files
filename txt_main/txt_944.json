In all Muslim countries that have stable governments, even minorities enjoy their rights. Look at Pakistan, its having a Santa Themed train that is traveling nationwide for Christmas. How many western governments give so much to their minorities?","post_message":"Fantastic"},{"comment_id":"10152564279192623","commenter_b":"Notice everytime it moves up and down is when she brakes.

Those appear to be all Cows (baby factories if you would). Kill off all of those and there is no way to reproduce any more. Who ever told you the Elk were overpopulated? Did you read it in a newspaper somewhere? Or have a Fish Cop mention it? Or perhaps just another Liberal with a big mouth and an empty head.","commenter_a":"More like training the young wolves to kill. The meat is then left uneaten and wasted. That's a very good reason to get rid of the wolves before the Elk are extinct.","post_message":"Wildlife officials describe a 'surplus kill' as when animals kill more prey than they can eat, leaving the surplus."},{"comment_id":"10154559728153812","commenter_b":"@username He has lead our country in more debt than any other presidents He doesn't give social security costs of living raise in 3 years He's letting illegals into our country without being vetted He's trying to take guns away","commenter_a":"You Americans, I can't believe how you can produce great leaders like Obama and then still show up with Trump for the next elections.","post_message":"Donald J.

A party of the people. Even a small number of seats in the Senate will be very influential. This would apply to the House, state governors, all the way through to mayors and local city counsels are all controlled by big money politics. We must stop trans-national corporations, and their billionaire owners from sucking the life out of us!

It's a weird denial-fetish.","post_message":"\"We need third parties in this country. And by that I don't mean another third party supported by billionaires, that centrist, you know, in the sort of Ross Perot manner. I mean parties that represent different opinions on the spectrum in the manner of the populist party in the 1890s which was really the last time we saw a third party movement, that contested the ballot from the bottom all the way to the top and they were a real political party.   Unfortunately the techniques that the populists used are against the law in most states. If we were to repeal those laws you might have a vibrant third party scene again.\" - Thomas Frank, author of the new book \"Listen Liberal\" in a 2012 conversation with Bill Moyers."},{"comment_id":"10157254857370354","commenter_b":"Punch that Bitch","commenter_a":"If he had a background like that, other wives would come forward.
