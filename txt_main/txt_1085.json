Weeping, he told her the following story: \"I lived in Germany during the Nazi holocaust. I considered myself a Christian. I attended church since I was a small boy. We had heard the stories of what was happening to the Jews, but like most people today in this country, we tried to distance ourselves from the reality of what was really taking place. What could anyone do to stop it? A railroad track ran behind our small church, and each Sunday morning we would hear the whistle from a distance and then the clacking of the wheels moving over the track. We became disturbed when one Sunday we noticed cries coming from the train as it passed by. We grimly realized that the train was carrying Jews. They were like cattle in those cars!

But they have no choice. Nobody in their right mind believes that we can deport all illegal immigrants without devastating our economy and millions of families. Even Trump admitted that they could come right back, a weak attempt to lessen the blow of his ridiculous plan. Yet another win for Bernie Sanders, who has no need to flip on issues to garner support.","post_message":"Your takeaway from the 4th Republican Presidential Debate?"},{"comment_id":"10153491435486880","commenter_b":"Wal-Mart will fall fast, probably years from now when \"Fresh\" is in Full Force! @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Cj Gennaro","post_message":"Amazon.com had a really good day."},{"comment_id":"909598592517510","commenter_b":"what a load of crap get off facebook,snapchat,instagram, pintrest,tumbler and go to sleep before 1am then see what happens and u are up at 630 because it u move so slowwwwwww be organized :) and btw u start at 9am","commenter_a":"@username Dannii Leask","post_message":"We might as well be sending teens to school in the middle of the night."},{"comment_id":"10153778726835575","commenter_b":"These fuckers are welcome in GB but not Trump.

The point of a dating site is to meet potential partners, usually of the opposite sex. How many women are subscribed to Ashley Madison I wonder? Oh, wait. I forgot! If a woman is on a site like this it can't be because she is a \"cheating dirtbag\"! It must be because she is \"exploring female empowerment\". Both sexes have a sex drive that can override sensible decision making processes. Both men and women are equally capable of cheating on their partners, so please The Huffington Post drop the \"all men are evil\" act and think before you type!","post_message":"“Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...\" Ashley Madison"},{"comment_id":"10154119835601770","commenter_b":"Give those real freaks, real deplorables if you will... a hand they know Clinton is one of them!!","commenter_a":"They feel sorry for the looser and I mean a dirty looser","post_message":"Remember when Vice President-elect Mike Pence was booed at 'Hamilton'?"}]
