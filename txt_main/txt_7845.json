She is a bought subsidiary of large business. If Sanders isn't nominated I'm staying home. She won't get my vote. Edit: I also will never forget the racism and division of Hillary supporters who made the entire DNC kiss their ass to mend fences. It's not \"her turn\" and if I had my way she would never ever see the White House.","post_message":"Let's not do the GOP's bidding."},{"comment_id":"1725568321015816","commenter_b":"I see lots of people who are saying \"see a wall won't help..\" Well the truth is the government doesn't give a crap about drugs coming into this country. They will make their money off addicts and death and jail time. What the government won't make money off of is illegal immigrants not paying taxes. That's the only reason for the wall. The government just wants their cut.","commenter_a":"Nick Cal","post_message":"800-yard-long tunnel found between Mexico and San Diego containing 1 ton of cocaine and 7 tons of marijuana.

This will be the beginning of the end. People have no idea what Hilary and Obama are doing behind our backs. Their evil and hatred goes much deeper and more wide spread than you can imagine. This is not a joke, it is coming.","post_message":"Some say this sign is extremely disrespectful to President Obama and should be removed on that basis alone. This man says it's his property, and the First Amendment gives him the right to keep the sign up.

Blaming good Democrats for not getting things done and ignoring Republican majorities blocking them. They don't help. They just \"manage\" from the side lines. Bernie at least has worked some in legislation, but not as hard or as successfully as Hillary. Dr. West has done nothing put complain that people who are doing the heavy lifting are not working hard enough.","post_message":"What do you think about his choices?"}]
