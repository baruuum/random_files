Meanwhile every civilization that recorded their history speak of giants. How can one make up or imagine Giants without being exposed to them or having seen them? Just like they wrote about hybrid races u think they made it up? Nope I think archaeologists (not all) but as a whole cover things up so they can keep getting funded. I don't by into dinosaurs, I think they are the hybrids ancient cultures speak about but hey if a man in a white lab coat says the grass is really blue a third of mankind would eventually start to see blue too. To each Is own tho","post_message":"A team of archaeologists have uncovered the skeletal remains of a giant in the Bulgarian city of Varna. Located on the eastern shores of the Black Sea, Varna is now a major tourist attraction. The area has a rich culture and its history goes all the way back to 5,000 BC. The oldest golden treasure in the world was found during excavations at the Varna Necropolis and carbon dating revealed it was buried more than 6,500 years ago.
