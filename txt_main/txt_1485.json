Shame on them for proving the children's point.","post_message":"Some Jefferson Parish deputies won't volunteer for security detail at Bonnabel High School football games after several team members kneeled during the national anthem during last weekend's game."},{"comment_id":"10152812337251749","commenter_b":"#iAmProudiAmBlack. #MyGirlFriendisBlack bcoz i only wanted a beautiful lady.
