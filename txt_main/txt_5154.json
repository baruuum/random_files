No the kids shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff but why would a grown woman behave that way over some toys and trash.","commenter_a":"This woman didn't handle this situation well at all. That being said, don't parents teach their children what respect is any more??","post_message":"News of the weird....   An anonymous threat said, \"The children look delicious. May I have a taste?\""},{"comment_id":"10153315672229091","commenter_b":"It's not cheap, it's very expensive. the apartments on either side, below and floors above have to be treated to truly eradicate the pest from the building. All that cost big $$$$ It's not funny. I don't blame her for looking for an inexpensive way to kill them. She should have done more research tho","commenter_a":"Theres people laughing and then I'm reading \"Stop being cheap and call an exterminator...... Who knows if this woman call an exterminator for an estimate and it was way above her budget none of us know that everyone go through different things I wouldn't recommend dousing yourself in rubbing alcohol but I'm sure if she would have looked on line she could have found a more better way. I don't understand how people can sit here and judge the next person like as if their better than the next. At least she apologized if that's the case and if thats how you feel then you should reach out and help her afford an exterminator","post_message":"The woman said doused herself with rubbing alcohol before it was ignited by a stove and oven. She said she had turned on the stove and oven the previous day to heat up her apartment, on advice from a neighbor, as part of the effort to kill the bedbugs."},{"comment_id":"10153084060819330","commenter_b":"I.

This kind of game playing makes you look more the fool. Most people today couldn't pick a transgender out of a line-up of people. They've been using our public bathrooms according to the sex they identify with, live and dress as, all these past decades to no uproar. Now all of the numskulls have come out of the woodwork claiming their women and children will be raped in the toilet stall because men are going to swarm into the ladies room because the law says they can. Get this: sexual predators don't follow laws in the first place and no law will stop them from getting their next victim be it in a bathroom or anywhere else.","commenter_a":"I will be packing better know what you are doing or you will be peeing like a girl for real !!!","post_message":"You want to try using the ladies' room, bro . . . the politicians and the media might be OK with you, but as for the ladies themselves, I wouldn't be so sure."},{"comment_id":"1025085544195452","commenter_b":"@username , are you Canadian ?
