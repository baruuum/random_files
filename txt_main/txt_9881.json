Why should we have to be subjected to her cop bashing, Black Panther, Malcolm X etc. opinions. That's not talent. Perhaps we should go back to marching bands and perhaps you should think about reporting the news or even better retiring.","commenter_a":"Wow these comments are funny to me. Beyonce did not give a hateful message. You all are upset because of what you saw visually and what the media has told you what she is singing about. Have any of you even listened to the song or listened to her response to the media turning her song into hate? And she and her husband have done a lot for the black community. They just don't have the media around to show it because that is not what it's all about.","post_message":"Brenda's Last Word on Beyonce's so-called 'way too political' Super Bowl performance.

ESPECIALLY after he asked her to call the social worker!! That poor little boy knew there were people out there that could help him, and then realized how bad he was being failed by everyone","post_message":"In testimony during the preliminary hearing, teacher Jennifer Garcia said in the months before Gabriel Fernandez's death, she repeatedly reported to county child service workers new signs of abuse that prosecutors say came at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend.   In one instance, Gabriel came to school with swollen eyes and a pockmarked face, she said. At first, he said he had fallen, but he then told her,  mom shot me in the face with a BB gun, she testified.  On two occasions, she testified, a fearful Gabriel asked,  you call that lady?, referring to the county social worker. But as months passed, and the boy remained with his mother, Garcia said she began to lose confidence in child protective services."}]
