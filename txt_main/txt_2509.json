Sure enough one of them would just sort of drift away--go outdoors or to his room. It was an instant notification as to whom the culprit was. So the Puffy Orange Juvenile is drifting away? Bingo! That's enough for this old mom.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10152944576132061","commenter_b":"Good thing they aren't dogs- the barbarians would skin them alive and eat the,.","commenter_a":"@username I want one for my birthday!!!","post_message":" China debuts its newborn panda twins: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153978615223812","commenter_b":"Go Hillary! 2016!!!","commenter_a":"GO BERNIE","post_message":"Here's what the ABC team is doing in the minutes leading up to the #DemDebate..."},{"comment_id":"1394765567230964","commenter_b":"Because they enjoy it. They love to rape. That's it.","commenter_a":"Im still confused. Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. ðŸ˜•","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"10153162579468908","commenter_b":"Unfortunately A LOT of people fall into this category.
