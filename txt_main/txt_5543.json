Because you have been such a good friend and a strong supporter of all my efforts, I wanted you to know first that tonight I will do more than just say goodnight on my Fox show.  I will say goodbye.  This is the last edition of Huckabee on the Fox News Channel. It has been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasnÂ¹t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.  There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President.  I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support.  As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to leave a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America.  I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"},{"comment_id":"1593060860989996","commenter_b":"Thats how they want America ....in a trance.","commenter_a":"May I suggest Sarah Palin as a running mate?

Trump knew the debate went badly by the way he barreled into the \"spin room\" last night, immediately disavowing things he'd said in front of more than 80 million people just moments before. The back-peddles and lies have only grown more mystifying in the hours since."},{"comment_id":"683462628486873","commenter_b":"Thank you for sharing!!","commenter_a":"Every time I attend a sporting event in our great country it infuriates and saddens me at how many \"Americans\" won't remove their hat or stop what they are doing while the National Anthem is played.
