I voted for this sales increase to pay for the improvements that put my city on the list of one of the best cities to live. Low crime, lush, great shopping, great roads, many services, about 15 parks, good schools and I live in a well kept condo complex where my HOA dues are over 300.00. The only blight I ever see are the smelly, stained mattresses and unwanted cheap furniture that slobs leave next to the more than amble sized trash areas. They dump in the middle of the night bec they're too cheap to pay to have them hauled away properly. My neighbors and I have concluded it is the renters here. They have no stake in keeping up the complex. The HOA pays for the removal weekly. The trash man ...","commenter_a":"Disgraceful.","post_message":"Do you have a discarded mattress on your block?

I imagine he certainly wouldn't have used social media to put down homosexuals because he would have been too busy loving them.","commenter_a":"The strong homosexual, transgender movement today is not surprising. It is a sign of how there will be a new world order. It is disturbing but it also points closer to our seeing Lord Jesus.","post_message":"\"Vines argues that while the Levitical code forbids homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22) it also forbids eating shellfish (Leviticus 11:9-12). Yet, he says, Christians no longer regard eating shellfish as wrong — so why can't we change our minds on homosexuality? Here Vines is rejecting the New Testament understanding that the ceremonial laws of Moses around the sacrificial system and ritual purity were fulfilled in Christ and no longer binding, but that the moral law of the Old Testament is still in force.\""},{"comment_id":"10152972323790950","commenter_b":"Sick bastards!!!!","commenter_a":"For now...I am going to let this investigation work itself out for evidentiary findings.

Good for her for getting rid of that douche.","commenter_a":"The same thing happened to my best friend when she started to make a healthier lifestyle for herself. Her now ex wouldn't support her at all! She was supposed to come to the gym with me one day and completely bailed out because she was fighting with her a**hole boyfriend. Turns out he told her that she's fat, will always be fat and that there was no point in going to the gym with me when she'll quit anyway. Now I wasn't aware about what he told her until recently because she was so ashamed of what he told her and knew I'd bash the crap out of him. He'd also accuse her of cheating every single time she went out or \"joke\" to her about texting other guys whenever she pulled her phone out. He was the one who ended up cheating (or so we think but I'm sure ...","post_message":"Alexander's husband started calling her \"fat\" after she dropped weight to save her health."},{"comment_id":"1214715148582648","commenter_b":"That IS NO lady!","commenter_a":"This is one sick lady","post_message":"WHOOPIE GOLDBERG: Right To Abort Baby Same As Right To Celebrate Birth Of Jesus Christ [VIDEO]"}]
