Now.","commenter_a":"I get where the author is coming from and she makes a valid point. In this case though I think the mommy comments were engendered by Beyonce's show stopping 10 minute celebration of being black, being a woman, and being pregnant. Her presentation as an Isis figure/fertility goddess all flowed into the dynamic she created, so it's understandable that Adele and Faith related to her that way. Beyoncé was the mother of the night and that's how she planned it. If she performed formation and wasn't pregnant for example, this article would be more warranted. I think the whole mammy/mommy comparison arises because it's impossible to escape the history and application of white supremacy whenever colored people deal with Western institutions like the Grammy's. The concept of disposable black women, which Beyoncé essentially demolished in her performance, is baked into our society and forms a large part of the reason ...","post_message":"On the Grammy stage, both Adele and Faith Hill commented that they wanted Beyonce to be their .

The right personality and talking the way we like without looking at policies, are the criteria the Democrats selected Obama in 2008. Donald Trump has supported a net worth tax, 35% tarrif, he supports amnesty and a path to citizenship, \"because there are jobs Americans just won't do,\" He's donated to clinton Pelosi & Harry Reid, and has said Bush is the worst president ever. He's a RINO and a caricature of a conservative inartfully voicing every failed mudsling of the left against conservatives. Ted Cruz is a world class debater, with a nearly perfect record who takes on both Democrats and spineless Republicans. He has all the positives and then some without the negatives of Trump. #TedCruz2016 @webpagelink","post_message":"NEW 'SILENT MAJORITY'"},{"comment_id":"10155791972890725","commenter_b":"STFU","commenter_a":"and a lot of people blame the police in one out of five hundred killings. what happen to hope and change under obama?","post_message":"Police say the victim, identified as Vonzell Banks, was likely not the intended target ----> @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1304804312923886","commenter_b":"Your kids would be better off in a Orphanage than with you..","commenter_a":"Lock them up","post_message":"They blazing new trails."}]
