Would you just accept thousands of people without carrying out appropriate checks (ie checking if they have criminal record, etc)? You wouldn't.

You both say the state of Illinois has lax gun control. In the city of Chicago, not the state of Illinois gun crime very high and so is gun control.

I am safer in a restroom with a transgender than I am with \"straight\" people! Transgenders are NOT peeping toms!
