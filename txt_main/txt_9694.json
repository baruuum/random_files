You think all that is fair for us to pay the bills of someone illegally sneaking across our boarder or overstaying there visa. How many Americans have been murdered or robbed or raped by them? Far to many!","commenter_a":"Everyone are immigrants to US America ....

The only difference is that its unique and stands out a bit because it's so absurd. I'm still going to have to fun.","commenter_a":"I feel like I am constantly defending Hartford - telling people how far the city has come, and all of the neat things there are to do here. But this? This, I cannot defend. I was super excited for this stadium, and now, for the first time, I am truly embarrassed for and by this city that I have grown to love. Temporary attention that derives from a stupid name doesn't breed long term community commitment. It just gives jaded locals more things to complain about, instead of taking pride in their city. Such a shame.","post_message":"After weeks of waiting, we now know the name of Hartford's baseball team."},{"comment_id":"10154365677768008","commenter_b":"I just hope she don't hide when she delivers.","commenter_a":"Your Holiness, thank you for all you do for the world if you are watching!","post_message":"BABY WATCH (10am update): Still no baby giraffe yet!
