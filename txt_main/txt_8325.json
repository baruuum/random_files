Religion has had so much control in history that by taking a little bit away they think the world is persecuting them. In my opinion they should let gay people do what they want just like they think Muslims should mind their own business about others eatting pork.","commenter_a":"wow - I am honestly confused as to how gay couples marrying really affects your lives? whether it be against your religious beliefs or whatever your reasons are for hating these people, does it truly affect how your life is going? There are so many other things in this world that should be worried about, like how our veterans are being treated and cops being stalked and killed, does two people being in love and wanting to be married change your life? and btw, no, I am not gay. I would just rather see more love in this world than hate and violence.","post_message":"North Carolina and Utah Laws Allow Clerks to Refuse Same-Sex Marriages  More than 30 magistrates in North Carolina have legally refused to perform weddings for gay couples.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"946547988774787","commenter_b":"Theresa, get a job, I'm retired!
