Mom is so concerned etc. But that three month old needs his/her parents not daycare workers anyway. Plus no charges should be filed if daycare was not made aware of the lactose intolerance. Sounds like a lil neglect on both sides of this. Plus whoever took the video should have stopped this from even happening. This worker although breaking the rules was trying to help out a baby who is clearly already in duress when the parents should be the one taking care of them at such young age. I can almost bet that mother is more mad she had to take her kid to the hospital and missed out of her drinking time and watching tv time.
