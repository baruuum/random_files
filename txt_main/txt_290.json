We need to stand up and love one another despite differences! Isis has definitely scared a lot of people. It would be nice if the Muslim community would make a statement in response to the killings around the world. Just to declare they are different of the terrorist and that what Isis has done is wrong. Then I think there would be a better understanding of Muslims. But even still there will remain evil people , like this man at Kroger. I'm constantly praying for our world. The world needs love. The world needs God. Blacks against whites. Whites against Arabs. Muslim against christian.

It's always been dreadful since the concept of Zionism reared its ugly head and will never be any better only worse until Zionism is banished totally and the Palestinian people allowed to dictate their own terms. Israel should have no say in the matter, only the people who lived in Palestine and can prove it, no matter what their religion, should have the say in the reconstruction of Palestine.
