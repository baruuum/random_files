Basically they can't use it for their cattle if it is protected for other wildlife. And they can't shoot the wolves that might harm their cattle because it is public land. (or they should not be allowed to). The deal is - for any business (including ranching and farming) there is risk for loss. The ranchers just don't want there to be any loss for them. But that is tough. That is life and that is business.","commenter_a":"Seriously amazing. .. I don't understand why they are so hell bent on getting rid of wild horses. .
