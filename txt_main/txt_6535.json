First time for everything, I guess","post_message":"The term \"manslamming\" comes from one woman's claim that she walked around NYC without moving out of anyone's way and almost every man slammed into her but almost no women did.   So National Review's Katherine Timpf decided to try it out herself  and 66 women ran into her vs. just 23 men. You can see video of all the slams here:"},{"comment_id":"10154161430028635","commenter_b":"Which is exactly why feminists aren't equalists, because they haven't dropped the privileged first-class citizenship baggage yet.","commenter_a":"My husband's previous wife took his son five states from him and the courts made him pay support without any effort to give the boy visits with his dad.

Look at the debt. Look how the 2nd amendment has been attacked. And our religious freedoms. What about the Isis.....we are walking away from the America I have known, and I am 78 yrs old,","commenter_a":"My husband and I are fine, but woe to my grand and great grandchildren in the years to come. They will never understand how truly great Ametica was, they will never know what freedom was...","post_message":"In November, Americans sent a clear message to Washington that they were tired of political gridlock and want solutions and real results to the problems facing our country. Both President Bush and President Clinton used their State of the Union address following difficult midterm elections to acknowledge that they no longer have control of both chambers and that it was time for them to work with Congress. Unfortunately, tonight was another missed opportunity for President Obama and his legacy.    President Obama used this evening to appease his political base and focused on dividing our Nation and using bureaucratic control to run our country with top-down Washington-centered solutions. I believe the key to growing a healthy economy begins by strengthening the paycheck of hard working Americans, putting more money into Kansans pockets, and growing our economy from the bottom-up.     While I was disappointed in many of the President's remarks, I remain hopeful there will be opportunities in the near future to work together to expand trade and fix our broken tax code. I remain hopeful that this President will seize those opportunities just as those who preceded him did."},{"comment_id":"1201199053280181","commenter_b":"For them girls that gotta get from one dick to the next real quickðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚","commenter_a":"Rebecca oh lawwwd noðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚","post_message":" "},{"comment_id":"956678911036116","commenter_b":"Trump is right !
