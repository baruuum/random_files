See what happened was the person who served the food dropped them exact three fries on the floor, that lady was actually being a good Samaritan and helping the cop and taking the dirty fries away for him so he did not get sick. Long story short don't do anything nice for cops because they are assholes and will do everything they can to abuse their power and fuck over the average civilian. I made all of this up of course but all of us know never even talk to a cop unless you absolutely have to because they are just looking for a opportunity to arrest anyone because they are bored. She should have just waited for her own fries.
