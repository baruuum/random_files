Adios America this nation is now a dump China & Russia are the leading nations now. Deceiving Hillary is going to backstab everyone. She will do anything to get your vote but at the end you will see her lies.","post_message":"Does Trump's violent rhetoric and bigotry remind you of something? Let's take a look back at history and find out...  Big thanks to Marianne DeMarco for making this video."},{"comment_id":"573149506180643","commenter_b":"They don't get nearly enough credit. Donald is right....stop them from entering the U.S. temporarily. We are in danger.","commenter_a":"Obama will probably have him fired for roughing up a terrorrist.","post_message":"Federal Agent Risks Everything To Stop ISIS Terrorist Disguised As Refugee From Setting Off Bomb In Texas  This man is a hero. Let's show him our support.  Can we get 50,000 'LIKES' for this federal agent?"},{"comment_id":"10154556355598690","commenter_b":"Some women just cant understand that others wish to cover up. Brainwashed since childhood to wear hardly anything.","commenter_a":"If the burkini is a symbol of Islamic extremism, then does that make the bikini a symbol of Western extremism or rather, Western subjugation of women? Surely freedom works both ways? Why should women be forced to show skin if they choose to cover up?","post_message":"Cannes Mayor David Lisnard called the full-body, head-covering swimsuit worn by some Muslim women \"the uniform of extremist Islamism\"."},{"comment_id":"1274246805922508","commenter_b":"Of course it's happening in England and if Americans don't wake up, you will see it here too. Open the Bible and read it with your family. it will show you who God is and who this muslim god is. Protect your family at all costs.","commenter_a":"If this is allowed to happen in the US, then mistakes have been made, and someone will need to pay!","post_message":"This school has taken things WAY too far.

Why isn't their team also punished? Wes Welker violated those rules with Denver. But it got retroactively sustained due to rule changes. Are you kidding?!?!","commenter_a":"In the end his punishment had nothing to do with deflated footballs. It was for behavior detrimental to the integrity of the game and the league. Read the letter to Brady explaining his punishment. Accountability goes a long way, too bad tb, belicheck and Kraft don't know the first thing about it.","post_message":"More bad news for Tom Brady."},{"comment_id":"1729203870680375","commenter_b":"@username Hillary still lies but that's true of most people who are liars. Dr. Carson must be desperate to dredge up a case this old.","commenter_a":"It's too bad these supporters, like Dr. Carson here, doesn't go after the things that Trump says and does everyday instead of something Hillary did 35 years ago. I'll bet a lot of us could dig into our pasts and find things we could have done or said better but yet we're going to vote for Trump, who is supposed to have maturity and says the most mean spirited things any Presidential nominee has ever said and he says these horrible things practically every day.","post_message":"Another woman from Clinton's past is speaking out."},{"comment_id":"1008713619198681","commenter_b":"She's a BAD example of a women !!!!","commenter_a":"Excellent ... +++","post_message":"Whoever you support in this election, it's important to mark historic firsts - and this is the first time that a woman from either party has won the Iowa caucus."}]
