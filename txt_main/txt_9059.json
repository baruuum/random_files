They are one of the worst.","commenter_a":"You let them know not to call you again usually by hitting 3 but it doesn't matter as they'll call you again using another number. Most are spoofed numbers. I had my own phone number come up on Caller ID one time! there is a site that you can check out numbers, www.800notes.com to let others know about the callers but the telemarketers don't care about that site. I see a lot of people on there saying to \"Stop calling me!\" yet don't leave their number. Yes, I'm tired of the \"Lower Your Credit Card Interest\" or letting me know about a topical pain ointment.

The timing for Baldwin’s hat couldn’t be better, coming as the president-elect sat down with security officials on Friday who told him the Russians helped him win the election — an assertion Trump flatly denies because it would contribute to the belief that his win is suspect having lost by over 3 million in the popular vote."},{"comment_id":"1250738951649087","commenter_b":"Only women to ever get you to take your bandana off","commenter_a":"@username when meg would come help you","post_message":"Oh boy!  #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"992882130761178","commenter_b":"#__ #__ #StopYazidiGenocide #StandforYazidiWomen","commenter_a":"@username: .","post_message":"A behind-the-scenes look at a historic night. hrc.io/269ym4J"},{"comment_id":"426081280913499","commenter_b":"Kiss my ass!!","commenter_a":"Not Surprised, a fight to fight, no reason just out of control.
