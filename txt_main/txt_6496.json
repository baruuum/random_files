I believe the teens who say the lady started yelling racist slurs and then slapped an underage girl. Then the racist lady called cops and lied to the police saying everyone was unruly and uninvited.","commenter_a":"It was not a pool party by all accounts....a dj set up beside a private pool and the pool was invaded by the people at the dj gathereing. And after being asked to leave by the security guard and being unruly ....the police were called and told a group of black individuals were causing trouble.....that s why th ey were focused on the black individuals....it was not a race thing. ...it was a group of disrespectful unsupervised kids being trouble....and they get attention from all of you...instead if being ignored by the public and handled by their parents....wow they have something to brag about now.....grow up and stay out of it and let the people involved handle it...","post_message":"He ran when the cop pulled out his gun."},{"comment_id":"10153268989822894","commenter_b":"A marriage should have 3 parties involved at all times!! Furthermore, I don't think women will ever understand how men think..ijs","commenter_a":"Y'all are so quick to judge. Giving him passes to cheat, doesn't necessarily mean he has cheated. And because she's allowing him to do it without being affected means that nothing is wrong with her self-esteem. If she just doesn't want to give her man something, then she leaves it up to him to decide where to get it. And who's to say he's making the decision to cheat? I highly doubt if she's allowing him to do it and not caring, then he isn't. That's so not how men work. And to say that they shouldn't have gotten married is stupid because they've been married for a while and I'm sure she has grown to bring about this decision with her husband. And you're not married for sex anyways.

And please dont call me DEAR!!","commenter_a":"Bernie is telling people what they want to hear not what he is capable to really get accomplished.His promises are not doable. They are unrealistic. Hillary has already accomplished many many good things for the poor and the middle class. Bernie is running on our ticket and using us. He is not a democrat and refuses to join our party, and has scorned our party for years. He is a left wing socialist. He voted against the Brady Bill and Amber Alert. He voted to protect the gun corporations and manufacturers against any and all law suits. He said that underage teenage girls should be allowed to have sex with their boyfriends not to get cancer. ( Wierdo) He also said toddlers should be allowed to to explore their sexuality with each other. He refused to serve in our military under concientious objection during the Viet Nam War when 55,000 ...","post_message":"It is clear that the views of the right wing do not reflect the views or the needs of the vast majority of the American people.
