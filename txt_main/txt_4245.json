I remember a girl in my youth group had brought one of her Mormon friends one summer's eve, and I got into a conversation with her and I'll remember what she said til the day I die- \"I'm not a Christian, I'm a Mormon!\" That would have been 74 or 75. Also, the concept that \"As God was, so man is; as God is so man may become\" is utterly missing from the other thee Abrahamic faiths.","commenter_a":"Um, no. The miracle IS the resurrection. The result is the atonement.","post_message":"A little bit of what I spoke about at church Sunday."},{"comment_id":"10154026224212869","commenter_b":"I agree! There are plenty of legitimate issues that should convince anyone paying attention that Clinton does not belong in the White House. I feel like spinning 100 different (and in many cases overwhelmingly mean spirited) conspiracy theories makes the relevant confirmed issues on either side carry a lot less weight. I'm not saying that I don't think her health may be an issue, or even that it shouldn't even be written about, but there are 100 different reasons for a vehicle like that to include a wheelchair lift.","commenter_a":"Is anyone else tired of these feeding frenzies, I for one am.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154736458587300","commenter_b":"Clinton's own faith says she should not be elected. For it is told in the bible, \" For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" ...and Jesus said to the Money Changers that his house was a house of prayers and they had made it into a den of thieves\" There is no Baptist, Catholic, or any other Christian that should be voting for Hillary Clinton.

They should just remove the robes and wear clown outfits.","commenter_a":"Franklin Graham The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled today that same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states. With all due respect to the court, it did not define marriage, and therefore is not entitled to re-define it. Long before our government came into existence, marriage was created by the One who created man and womanAlmighty Godand His decisions are not subject to review or revision by any manmade court. God is clear about the definition of marriage in His Holy Word: a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24). I pray God will spare America from His judgment, though, by our actions as a nation, we give Him less and less reason to do so.","post_message":""}]
