Who would pay for that. Our taxes would have to go way up to cover that. I don't think Don can cover that out of his own pocket.","commenter_a":"I am an American. My children are American. My Grandparents and Great Grandparents were immigrants to this country. They came from Poland, Germany and Italy. I am a woman. I am successful in the male dominated auto industry. Donald Trump has spoken against every good thing I have been taught to be proud of in America. He is a ignorant, lying buffoon. #imwithher","post_message":"Yesterday, Donald J. Trump said that the judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University should be disqualified from his job because, in Trump's words, he has “Mexican heritage.”   Judge Curiel was born in Indiana—and last I checked, that's in the United States of America. Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. He’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.   Let's be clear about what Trump is saying. He thinks that because Judge Curiel's family has Mexican roots, he can’t do his job. Donald Trump isn't just wrong about this; his words show that he’s wrong about America. He’s wrong about what makes this country great. And on a day that we are mourning Muhammad Ali, let's remember that we live in a country where people can break down barriers, worship their own god, choose their own name, and lead and follow their dreams as far as their hard work and talent will take them. I’ve always believed that in America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is—we should be judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, heritage, or religion. Well, it's time to judge Donald Trump by his words and deeds. And I believe that his prejudiced, bigoted words and deeds disqualify him from being President of the United States."},{"comment_id":"910297725696643","commenter_b":"Girls can be just as bad","commenter_a":"Could have been worse","post_message":"'I cleaned my son's room and found... a Pringles  tube full of URINE'"},{"comment_id":"1349633901749900","commenter_b":"@username, real women protect their babies, not kill them","commenter_a":"Any \"man\" who wants to try to control what women do with their body is a worthless piece of feces and they will be treated as such.","post_message":"The gift of life must be protected from the slaughter!

I find nothing wrong with what he said in 1971. Things were different then. I said things in 1971. Does that mean I'm a racist today? I am military where everyone's color is either desert camo or woodland camo. I find affirmative action quite racist. Employers should be able to hire people because of their skills not because of the color of their skin. Absolutely ridiculous.","post_message":"California lawmakers refuse to honor John Wayne! and here's why..."}]
