The teacher has to respect the students and vice versa. In hindsight the student should have went to the principal and then to his parents. Im in no way condoning what the student did but its a 2 way street. Dont bash the student when we dont know exactly what rhe teacher said. Racial slurs or any other forms of racism has no place in society. My kids or the kids I coach cant even say anything like that. Either way whatever was said isn't the problem. It was the lack of respect from the teacher and STUDENT.","commenter_a":"@username you say teachers need to watch what they say. I don't get it. What about the child. Dosen't he need to be taught. I don't like what you said so I punch you. There are other ways of handling verbal abuse. This is disgraceful.","post_message":"Witnesses say a Prince George's County Schools student punched his teacher over a racially insensitive comment: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154132565089087","commenter_b":"Thats it??

What world do you live in ?","commenter_a":"Whatever. If that kid was crying in the middle of some restaurant & the owner told the mother to leave for the sake of the rest of the patrons he'd be applauded. Taking a baby to a political rally is as foolish as taking a baby to a Slayer concert.
