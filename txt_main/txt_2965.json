More level headed than many on social media. Personally I think Islam and Christianity are both a blight to our species- but it is your RIGHT to believe whatever you want. I'll gladly defend your right to be or believe whatever you want. I know Islam and Christendom view me as an abomination because I am gay- I think that is incredibly stupid but I still respect their right to believe it. There is no reason a female officer could not have dealt with this lady and, after checking for contraband, allowed her to keep it on.","commenter_a":"I'm so tired of seeing this article. I wear a hijab and I've been wearing it for 10 years and it's just as much my identity. But if I'm asked to take it off, I will. There's plenty of times I've been asked to remove it for security reasons and I comply, and that's not even because I got arrested. I'm pretty sure God isn't going to smite me for showing my hair to comply with the laws of the country I was born in and choose to reside in, which ironically gives me more religious freedom than living in a Muslim country. Is it entirely fair that this happened, probably not. A female officer could have taken her picture. But that didn't happen, and unfortunately being asked to remove your headscarf in a non-Islamic county doesn't amount to a violation of rights in the same way as it would ...","post_message":"“I’ve worn my scarf for 12 years and my religion says that I can’t take it off.

Also if you think this is the best country in the world you must be ignoring the debt, constant war, and division of society by ethnicity, race, sex, religion etc. that is plaguing this country. So if you think this country is not oppressive then you are wrong. If you think this country represents equality you are wrong. If you think this country represents democracy you are wrong. If you think this country represents the bourgeoisie elite and capitalist greed then you are right and that is why I won't support the flag not to disrespect the troops who died but to respect them because they died only for greed and American imperialism.","post_message":"Allen West Republic"},{"comment_id":"10153001992671770","commenter_b":"discusting","commenter_a":"Who cares ??
