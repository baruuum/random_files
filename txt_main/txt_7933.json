Because as an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, Sanders, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the \"Trump Strong\" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Strong Again! Thank you.","post_message":"They do NOT want people to see this one!"}]
