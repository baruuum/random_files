Tried juicing for almost a year, cutting out eating \"real\" food almost all together... Ended up doing more damage to her gut than good. Bodies are made to eat food and not meant to get over loaded with vitamins and nuetrints from juicing 40 carrots.

What world do you live in ?","commenter_a":"Whatever. If that kid was crying in the middle of some restaurant & the owner told the mother to leave for the sake of the rest of the patrons he'd be applauded. Taking a baby to a political rally is as foolish as taking a baby to a Slayer concert.
