There you go, sorted.","commenter_a":"When a system (Teachers & Parents) is not focused on a child's future but instead going through the motions and meeting the targets with least amount of positive role models (especially in single parent families) you are not building future generations that think rationally where the brain itself arrives at a conclusion at a very young age that race is just a social construct, you are instead building a worker drone filled with prejudices and presumptions on top of entitlements that things are owed instead of earned.","post_message":"\"Education should provide an inclusive curriculum that teaches the students respect for other cultures. If schools provided such an education, the climate that allows racist language and behaviour would cease to exist. Promoting such an education should be a priority for government, however in Britain we have a school system that has little interest in education.\""},{"comment_id":"10155020049345500","commenter_b":"I can see you are a cold-hearted Republican, but are you a veterinarian?

On site it says mother told husband to hit 10 year old if she denied her husband sex. Under Yemeni law this is not rape, wife's duty. Most sickening nationality. Her own family says face up to her duty and honour families commitment, don't shame her family. One girl 10 years old got away, went to court and filed for divorce. She won, husband was not prosecuted for raping a child, he was paid $200.00 compensation.

Crime Bill vote, wasn't for gay marriage because he thought it was a 'states rights' issue. Voted to send Vermonts nuclear waste to a small latino poor town in Texas. Voted to FUND the war in Iraq and plenty of other wars. Couldn't even to get the members of the Progressive Caucus in congress, that he started, to support him. You lost. Get over it.","commenter_a":"Of course he can't give Hillary credit for winning on her own merits. It must be because of closed primaries, or \"the poor not voting,\" or whatever other excuse he can come up with. How about the fact that Bernie benefited from the caucus system in certain states that actually make it difficult for voters to participate & thereby lower turnout? I don't hear Hillary whining about that. #feelthewhine","post_message":"He's looking ahead."}]
