[{"comment_id":"10156744379040093","commenter_b":"@username Have you SEEN Trump on the debate stage? He doesn't know policy, he doesn't think ahead, and he stumbles when it comes to content. Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz. I write such because the thought of Trump facing Hillary in debate makes me cringe. Kasich, the newest favorite of the GOP, cannot win. I love my home state, but Ohio doesn't save Kasich from toppling.","post_message":"Not budging."},{"comment_id":"10153861210290950","commenter_b":"You kiss your Moms with that nasty mouth?","commenter_a":"Here is my thought. Don't show him on TV!! Focus on the team, the stands, and the rest of the stadium and to hell with him. If everyone stops making him big news, maybe we can all go back to watching football and the rest of the players on the field. Make him prove he even deserves to be out there, and sorry 49er fans, but before all this crap by him became news, I couldn't even tell you who he was. Maybe this is his way of getting some publicity because he ain't no Tom Brady or Peyton Manning!!! Let him sit, he may just earn the right to sit there all season!!!","post_message":"A veteran who supports the San Francisco 49ers quarterback tweeted: \"Don't use my service--or that of any veteran--to justify the silencing of black Americans.\""},{"comment_id":"570070006492803","commenter_b":"Beat trump I.

As always, remember to keep sending me your questions via text to ASKBEN (@username on your mobile phone).   There were many questions from all of you asking “what is one of your favorite things about Christmas?”     Honestly, I love to see the look on everyone’s faces as they open presents – that’s the best part for me, seeing the look children have in anticipation of a gift. During this season, I always try to remind myself of the greatest gift…our savior Jesus Christ.   I know that many of us spend the week leading up to Christmas frantically rushing around buying presents, our time occupied with “how much to spend” on loved ones, rather than spending much time occupied with those loved ones. It’s about relationship, not retail. We should remind ourselves of that more often.   It is easy to become distracted by the world when we are constantly being bombarded with competing priorities, our time becomes monopolized by differing pursuits and positions, fleeting moments that will pass. Our true pursuit should be everlasting, one that cannot be wrapped in bows, it does not perish. It is peace. It is good news, in pursuit of others as we share with those we encounter. Just as we are now, you and I, sitting here together sharing this moment in time, these are the moments that do not fade or wither upon snow’s first falling – this is the season to be joyous with one another, lift others as He has lifted you, our hands united in hope.   That is why Christmas is special to me – I am reminded of the greatest of gifts every time I see my children and grandchildren’s faces. Hope.   Thank you for sharing your evening with me, I look forward to many more.   Goodnight, Ben"},{"comment_id":"10153721851426178","commenter_b":"People are waking up. They don't need TV or papers anymore,until the net is more strangulation than it is now, serious voters make up their own minds and look at all sides of issues important to them. They are no candidates that one can agree 100% with but at least there are many out there there one can reconcile most of their views with and throw support that way.","commenter_a":"I have no use for the networks...","post_message":"Despite being the biggest story in the pro-life movement since Roe v.
