Also I don't know anyone that does not ask guests to leave at some point after a visit. Additionally most people use common sense to screen individuals that enter their homes. If the individual being considered as a guest is affiliated with a suspect group we error in the side of caution to protect or family and do not invite that individual or their affiliated friends into our home. In comparison to legal and illegal immigration into the USA it seems like the Democrats are telling us to unlock your doors while you sleep, don't use the locks on your doors while you watch TV, and when you leave for the day leave your ...","commenter_a":"The parallel is Jews = Christians.

Hillary has been exposed for who she is and it's not looking good for her. For she is so squeaky clean, why does she keep hiding from the media? She is always at home resting.

These premeditated murders were likely politically motivated acts of terrorism. This is the same stuff we saw when the American left attempted to impose their will on peace loving citizens through bombings, political assassinations, physical attacks on returning service members, and violent protests back during the 1960s. For those of us who were children at the time, watching this stuff on the nightly news became indelibly burned into our psyche. It was a scary time for our country. Terrorist groups like the Weather Underground were one of a number of groups that committed acts of terror against some of our most honored institutions. Bill Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground.
