Now, we may be up against super PACs and billionaires, but when the election comes around, Donald Trump and the Koch brothers with all their money, they only get one vote each. One person, one vote. That’s what we believe.  No one should be able to take that vote away. That’s why we cannot turn away and close our eyes from all of the attacks on voting rights that are happening right now. They don’t just threaten the integrity of our elections, although they do. They threaten what it means to be a citizen—indeed, what it means to be an American.\" —Hillary yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama"}]
