Even our simplest tools at one point put someone out of work, probably starting with the wheel. If you want to walk away from technology (or just some technology) that's your choice, just don't try and force others to pay for your choice.","commenter_a":"Low skill workers have been making this argument for generations since the first automation came about and it still doesn't work. Someone still has to design, manufacture, install and service the machine. Someone has to stock supplies for it to use. Still plenty of jobs, just not the job you were doing yesterday. They are also overlooking the other basic problem that the Government doesn't create wealth. If you get a freebie from Uncle Sam, that came out of someone else's hard earned money via taxes. If we're all sitting at home due to this miracle automation, then there's nobody around to pay the taxes to fund the government. It simply doesn't work. Worse, we've seen countless times around the world how it doesn't work and people still don't get it.","post_message":"Simply put, the idea is that Uncle Sam will cut citizens a regular paycheck whether they work or not."},{"comment_id":"1859557927611142","commenter_b":"Will be done if u pulled this shit lmao","commenter_a":"@username lolðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚","post_message":"Cold! #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"10153548183098984","commenter_b":"Unless you're Native American, almost all Caucasians have ancestors that were thieves, murderers, and rapists. Shall we remember our horrible history? Shall we remember how Caucasians forced their way through other's land? Shall we remember the genocide that occurred? Shall we remember public lynches? Shall we remember the Trail Of Tears? Shall I go on?..... Who are the TRUE criminals here? Caucasian ancestors FORCED their way through due to greed. Most other immigrants come to America to WORK to provide for their family. So I repeat, UNLESS you're Native American, you come from immigrants as well, possibly even illegal. You're ancestors (Caucasian), if they've been here since the 1700s or 1800s, could have been the murderers, thieves, and rapist roaming around tormenting innocent.
