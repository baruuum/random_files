If the software is created to unlock this phone, it can be used to unlock any phone. They all use the same data encryption software. This would put all of Apple's customers (hundreds of millions of us around the world) in danger of our privacy being breached by thieves or overreaching governments. Apple has complied with every aspect of this investigation otherwise, including providing data stored on its servers as required by warrant. But the software needed to break into the rest of the data on this phone doesn't and shouldn't exist.","commenter_a":"The order specifically refers to *this* phone, specifically allows Apple the option of doing it on *their* premises, and specifically allows *Apple* to retain control of the method used.

Here is what I think a solution to the problem could be. No matter where the immigrate is coming from. Though not my original idea it is a workable one - All immigrate males between 18 & 50 to be immediately inducted into the military to receive basic training, After completion, sent back to their country of origin, then given their weapons and told to defend and reclaim their own country. After they accomplish that we send them their families because they would have no excuses to come here. If they refuse to do this then they and their families can find another country that will take them because they would never make an AMERICAN anyway. We should not have to send OUR military to their country to fight and die ...","commenter_a":"We don't need 1,400 years of cosanguineous brain damage.

How did the US government start this war? The Syrians and everyone else out in North Africa and the Middle East have access to the internet and make their own decisions. When people have access to information freely they act accordingly. People have free will to think and make decisions. No one forced the Syrians to fight or oust Assad. He cracked down on protests violently and this is the result.","commenter_a":"How can Assad sleep at night knowing he is responsible for the deaths of 300,000+ of his own people.
