Evil Hillary, said that no one needed guns - Trump said, OK - start with dis-arming your security guards. What does she do? Tripled her armed guards. Queen Liar Hillary / that Muslim Traitor Obama / & Soros are the U.S. worst 3 enemies that we have ever had. Because of all the evil Muslims that they have flooded our country with - we will probably be in a Civil War here on our soil - before the election - since they are losing really bad - they will not wait to try a Complete Muslim Take Over. Obama's ISIS has already stated -- We will Kill 90% of all Americans before 2017. Of course, that will be All White & Christians.

Trump said the same thing ,but you just look over it.","post_message":"Watch for yourself and you be the judge. Hillary was asked about wanting to assassinate WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, using a drone. Assange has been a thorn in her side throughout her campaign.  When she finally answered, I've gotta say, I was more uneasy than when the reporter asked the question. This is NOT someone I would want in the White House under any circumstances.  Do you find her answer as disturbing as I do?"},{"comment_id":"10155098907990329","commenter_b":"I'm always grateful to be corrected, especially when someone is able to be patient with me even though I'm not owed it :)","commenter_a":"My family has been calling this season's theme \"A Haunting\" because of the reenactments and stuff. I like the season so far but guys, what happened to the people of Roanoke really isn't that big of a mystery. Most likely after part of the group left to get supplies more colonist died from a mix of starvation and attacks. They then most likely moved to settle with the Croatoan tribe for both help feeding themselves and protection. It also helps explain the upsurge in Croatoan children with blonde hair or other features that are rare, though not unheard of, in their genetic pool. Basically, your elementary school teacher lied to you. Other lies you learned in history class: the Mayans didn't just mysteriously disappear. They over farmed the valleys they lived in and could no longer continue to occupy large cities and began living in smaller groups. They're are still ...","post_message":"Mind blown. // American Horror Story"},{"comment_id":"10153584406778352","commenter_b":"stupid girls!!!","commenter_a":"They need to be committed for a long long time","post_message":"Two Teenage Girls Kidnapped a 14 Year Old, Made Her Masturbate, and Tortured Her For 17 Hours By Scalping Her Hair and Pouring Salt Down Her Throat"},{"comment_id":"541791876011392","commenter_b":"Isnt it still a punishable offense in the eyes of the law if it is then the people who are doing this should be arrested and jailed and fined of course i meen after they get their ass's stomped .","commenter_a":"Needs a beating","post_message":"This liberal thought he could burn an American flag, big mistake.

So 1 baby couldn't keep him, she needed 2??","post_message":"This 3-week-old baby, kidnapped and discarded in a trash dumpster, was the innocent pawn in an \"evil\" woman's elaborate plot to convince her married boyfriend that she had given birth to his twins, police said.  Giseleangelique D, 47, of Thousand Oaks allegedly sought out young mothers under the guise of a charitable organization looking for women with 1 to 2-month-old infants to assist.  That's how D found Eliza Delacruz, police say. She allegedly stalked the infant's mother and then had a co-conspirator snatch the child. Three other people were also arrested in the alleged plot, which includes an attack on another mother and child in El Segundo.   What investigators say they can't figure out is why 3-week-old Eliza was killed.  Read KTLA's story here: @webpagelink"}]
