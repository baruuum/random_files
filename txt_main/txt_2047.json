If the software is created to unlock this phone, it can be used to unlock any phone. They all use the same data encryption software. This would put all of Apple's customers (hundreds of millions of us around the world) in danger of our privacy being breached by thieves or overreaching governments. Apple has complied with every aspect of this investigation otherwise, including providing data stored on its servers as required by warrant. But the software needed to break into the rest of the data on this phone doesn't and shouldn't exist.","commenter_a":"The order specifically refers to *this* phone, specifically allows Apple the option of doing it on *their* premises, and specifically allows *Apple* to retain control of the method used.
