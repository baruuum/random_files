That 1/2 had a crowd, the rest of the mall was sparsely filled but you could only see that from an ariel view. Crowd scientists say Trump's inauguration crowd was half the size of Obama's and they are correct, especially when you compare views of both ends of the mall--anyway--who really cares about this anymore?","commenter_a":"Obama was the first African American president I would expect the crowd to be quite larger for him","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154452810413812","commenter_b":"Kick her out..

The big news network had been obviously bias against one candidate and it seems that this candidate cannot do anything right for them for obvious reasons. Even the Roman Catholic hierarchy are all bent on preventing our presidential candidate to win the election. But lo and behold the people have spoken and are up in arms against these giant nerworks and rallied their candidate of choice to win decisively. Wake up America you are being manipulated by a few who have selfish interest and only have themselves to enjoy if their will be done.","post_message":"President George W.

I'm finding your people somewhat heartless and they sound from my perspective to be violent and racist themselves... No different in fact than the terrorists that have become their perpetrators. This is what fear does to people.. Aggressive behaviour .. We are so much more than this. I felt so sad when I read the response to Obamas humanitarian speech. So sad that you people have such fear and hatred inside you. This attitude of hatred and intolerance against people you don't even know personally will never make a better world. It just perpetuates the same old story. I feel Sad. Very very sad today.","post_message":"\"Many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves ‚Äì that's what they're fleeing.
