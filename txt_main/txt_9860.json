Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Great Again!

Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim. 2. Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump without being able to win at the negotiating table. 3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don need a policy expert or a legislator we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale. 4. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars.
