So Obama has almost rescued us from the disaster the Republicans left us when Bush was in office. But don't notice that stuff, focus on bathrooms and what Muslims are doing in countries you can't even find on a map.","post_message":"#BoycottTarget  #PRDisaster #TalkIsCheap"},{"comment_id":"1137481012959422","commenter_b":"Get the hell out, asswipes!","commenter_a":"I wish Scottland would welcome me in.

Do you want a POTUS ignoring federal laws?","commenter_a":"The left just can't help themselves. They have to cast this Trump... They have to portray him as somebody that's a walking mental midget, that literally has no idea what he's done here by winning the presidency, that has no idea how to talk, has no idea how to behave. They continue to make the mistake of plugging him into their model. They're plugging him into what they think an accomplished politician is, and he's not that, he's never been that, and he's not going to be that.","post_message":"‚ÄúTrump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers.

They are a whole level of crazy I don't want to be around. Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other! I can't wait for the future of America!üá∫üá∏üöÇ‚ù§Ô∏è","commenter_a":"Our country is full of spoiled people who are so used to having things their way, they act like a class of 5 y/o kids who didn't get the green marker! Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was \"stronger together, peace, love, equality\"......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters.
