I flew everywhere, because I didn't want to stay at home alone, my guy is a commercial pilot and I can fly for free..so why not?Because my cbc count was low, I had to fly with a mask on, because I had to. I even flew on Alaska airlines from Denver to anchorage. I believe this to be an isolated incident...I was always treated with dignity and respect and allowed to go down first because I said I felt weak..Because I did! So tell me what's the difference between if an elderly person says they feel weak and a cancer patient says it?","commenter_a":"Dear America, your bottom line is not more important than common courtesy or basic human rights.","post_message":"\"We need to make sure that ... corporations aren't so concerned with liability and bottom line that they overlook common sense and common decency.\""},{"comment_id":"10153248022411336","commenter_b":"John V Salazar","commenter_a":"We had a similar issue at a university I worked at years ago. The guy was just a creepy freak but he cried \"academic freedom\" and got away with showing porn in a music class and \"relating it to music\". Oddly enough, once he FINALLY retired, the class was discontinued as it had no value. There are times academic freedom goes too far and yet that is the basic premise of any university and with tenured faculty your hands are tied if they \"justify\" it.","post_message":"Parents, what do you think of this?

Nice job. I see you really are the pro life party.","commenter_a":"How can it be that after viewing the videos and seeing the sonograms that people can STILL only talk about the \"rights of the woman\"? How can that be? And the sad thing is the terrible damage abortion does to women and many men.","post_message":"BREAKING: The House has passed #HR3134, my bill to freeze all federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

Then compensate the Irish remember, \"Irish and dogs, need not apply\" Chinese, italians, \"WOPS\". And then we women, are expecting big checks for years of abuse. Finally, when you finish paying everyone off, well all go to work to pay the huge federal debt you ran up, and will have reached \"slave\"status. I want my check too, otherwise I'm going on wekfare.
