The middle class is paying for this by job lost and food stamps the working poor need.If this new trade agreement is good for America why is it fast tracking. America elite can build factories over seas and hire people there pay them enough to be able to buy the products they make.I believe we should start penalizing companies that move out of America for cheap labor abd export products back home. The USA will dominate no one if we do not start paying a living wage here and make jobs not loose jobs.THIS AGREEMENT BENEFITS COUNTRIES WHERE LABOR IS CHEAP THEY WILL HAVE JOB GROWTH EXPORTING TO THE USA,WE WILL BECOME A NATION OF TWO CLASSES THE ELITE AND THE POOR.","commenter_a":"There is nothing worse than a bunch of Puritans who are so sanctimonious that they would give comfort to the enemy -- people like Warren, Sanders, and Nader.

When, how it was delivered? Kelly is not responsible for Michael's career! If she is acting unprofessionally and retaliating or is having behavior that is inappropriate in a workplace, the network will need to enforce the EEOC policies and review her contract for creating a hostile environment. The decision to move his day to depart is in everyone's best interest. Maybe after 26 years she should look for a new job, maybe advance herself too. She does not decide when any employee leaves. I now refuse to even watch this show anymore since the Kelly drama and I hope family and friends turn her off and let the network see who has the power to decrease ratings here! He's advancing his career period. If ...","post_message":"“I needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts.
