Why is O allowed to take actions that have harmed this country in the eyes of the world???","post_message":"Yesterday, the Pentagon announced that the Russians could be told the location of our ground Special Operations troops in Syria, so that their Russian Air Force avoids them. This is a grave mistake. Once again, the President's administration demonstrates their inability to lead as Commander-in-Chief. Because he does not have an effective strategy for defeating ISIL/ISIS, he is putting troops on the ground without the protection of our air forces and asking the Russians, politely, to not bomb them. For over 50 years, our air forces have ensured no member of the American military has been killed by an enemy airstrike. I hope the Administrationâ€™s poor decision-making does not change this fact.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153291024331509","commenter_b":"They are, dummy.
