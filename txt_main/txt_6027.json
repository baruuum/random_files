Also I don't know anyone that does not ask guests to leave at some point after a visit. Additionally most people use common sense to screen individuals that enter their homes. If the individual being considered as a guest is affiliated with a suspect group we error in the side of caution to protect or family and do not invite that individual or their affiliated friends into our home.
