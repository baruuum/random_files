Fact is she would have already packed up her tent and left town to sell more books if this was 't Donald frigging Trump she was running against? That's something to be proud of? The second worst? You see that's where a candidate needs to be a good candidate to get my vote. In my book she's not, if your Presidential standards are that much lower, ok, vote for her. Mine aren't.","commenter_a":"Sorry Bernie, but I can't sit here and watch you degrade yourself into just another shill for her. You used to hate what she stands for. Now you endorse it.

I do not see near the support, energy, emotion, or urgency that I saw in the last two Obama campaigns, and lets be honest here folks... Hillary Clinton IS NOT barak obama.
