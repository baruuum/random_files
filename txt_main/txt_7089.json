Did they ask Ms Flossie if & when SHE wanted to be interviewed? It was all very awkward. They gave her a station coffee mug (shameful)... Put flowers on her lap that she can't hold... The kicker to me was the opening where the interviewer held up the newspaper RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER FACE!!!!

She went thru 12 hours of gruesome testimonies with congressional republicans and didn't even break a sweat and was able to squash all of them like cockroaches. On the other hand, Donald Trump choked during a 1 hour meeting with the Mexican President and he choked and sweated bullets while being interviewed by Faux News Megan Kelly.","commenter_a":"Jordan Elum","post_message":"#Repost Ivanka Trump #Instagram â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ Smooches from baby Theodore. ðŸ˜˜ #Latergram"},{"comment_id":"1265724350133686","commenter_b":"Honestly , I couldn't vote for either ..
