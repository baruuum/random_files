Maybe you can sensationalize more Halloween hoarder homes while you're at it. I am glad Nickcole Dykema didn't actually hurt any Deputies (and she most likely could have, ambushing them in her own home like that), and glad the Deputies didn't kill her. This is a lesson for Police dealing w/ the mentally ill everywhere. I do hope this woman gets access to proper mental healthcare, and that through treatment she can find her way back into the world with peace and dignity.","post_message":"Multiple deputies received injuries at the \"house of horrors\"   From removing weapons from the \"booby trapped\" home"},{"comment_id":"10157328778620354","commenter_b":"Kimberly Dawn Horvath Mullins , most Muslim immigrants are actually highly educated doctors, lawyers, computer engineers.

Now, go get 'em.","commenter_a":"Choice satellite TV doesn't show FOX NEWS anymore so I don't get to see it. All we get is liberal news and I think this is just propaganda and time to cancel choice for violation of our contract.","post_message":"This evening I wanted to share with you some news that is very personal to me.  Because you have been such a good friend and a strong supporter of all my efforts, I wanted you to know first that tonight I will do more than just say goodnight on my Fox show.  I will say goodbye.  This is the last edition of Huckabee on the Fox News Channel. It has been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasn¹t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.  There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President.  I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support.  As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to leave a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America.  I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"}]
