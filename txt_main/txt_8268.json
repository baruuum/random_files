I saw my great grandmother suffer for other a year from emphysema that killed her very slowly. She started smoking at age 11 and didn't stop when she was 86 and still had O2 strapped to her face. Her lungs were almost solid black due to all the years of smoking. Its heartbreaking to have to watch your loved one suffocate in their own fluids all because of cigarettes... Seeing that I promised mysf I would never smoke, and I never have. Maybe I will get sick anyway, but at least I know I have the choice whether or not to expose myself to such a horrible toxin ridden thing. I still font understand why people ever pick one up knowing the effects on the body","post_message":"America's biggest #tobacco companies say they are ready and willing to pass along factual public health information about cigarettes."},{"comment_id":"10153531348054740","commenter_b":"I agree you shouldnt have to justify.","commenter_a":"It is sad that so many don't know the difference between real life and tv.....","post_message":"Here's why cops don't 'shoot to injure':"},{"comment_id":"1412614535483745","commenter_b":"Hey opee what the fuck did you ever do for our country.

Also James now that you've mentioned hospitals, in Syria we as a country have never bombed a hospital, it was Russian and Syrian Regime bombs that caused those explosions. Banning or restricting the immigration from certain countries has been happening for as long as the United States had borders. But this is the first time we have banned people of a certain religion from entering the country.

In fact, everything she's ever done has been solely for her own promotion and gain! Power is what she's after and we definitely DON'T want someone like her in charge of our country! Bernie is one of us, a man who's worked hard for positive change, who is diplomatic, anti-war and pro-planet, in short, just what we need at this particular moment in time! With Bernie, we would all have a say, whereas, with Hillary, as a people, we would become more suppressed than ever, given her plans for further militarisation, both military and police wise and polluting of our planet in favour of the almighty buck! Bernie puts the needs of THE PEOPLE first, which is why he must be our first ...","post_message":"When we talk about a political revolution, sisters and brothers, we don't just mean the presidency.
