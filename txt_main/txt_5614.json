But they have no choice. Nobody in their right mind believes that we can deport all illegal immigrants without devastating our economy and millions of families. Even Trump admitted that they could come right back, a weak attempt to lessen the blow of his ridiculous plan. Yet another win for Bernie Sanders, who has no need to flip on issues to garner support.","post_message":"Your takeaway from the 4th Republican Presidential Debate?"},{"comment_id":"414886538699640","commenter_b":"She needs to keep her legs closed and get a f*^king job....lazy ass","commenter_a":"That's sick","post_message":"She wants one more HUGE favor from us..."},{"comment_id":"10153854379994486","commenter_b":"Criminal Hillary, silly Bernie out, Biden in without costing him a cent","commenter_a":"Good!","post_message":"If they're not panicking yet..."},{"comment_id":"10153793064907452","commenter_b":"We have to go bail him out!!! 2,000 pesos!!!","commenter_a":"Sal zorro is at it again 😂😂","post_message":"As officers rushed to the Los Angeles International Airport amid false reports of shots fired, they encountered a man dressed as Zorro outside Terminal 7. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153324881199312","commenter_b":"1 in 100,000 people infected with measles died before the measles vaccine, meaning even if EVERYONE caught measles in the USA today only 3,000 would die, BUT thats if EVERYONE in America caught it, not millions, and because we take care of ourselves and wash our hands and eat slightly healthier that would not be the amount today anyhow, measles does not mean instant death, and if one more person tries to spread \"herd immunity\" crap I'm gonna lose it, it's not real!
