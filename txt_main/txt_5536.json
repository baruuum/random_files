All of us fought for you, not so you could buckle up like a belt and endorse Hillary. I refuse to vote for Hillary. You are letting us all down, all because of a back-room conversation where Barack likely asked you to \"fall in line\". I'm concerned, but still very hopeful that you get up on that stage at the DNC, and demand that your followers vote 3rd party!!!!!","post_message":"I want to express my pride in what we have accomplished together over the last year. But so much more must be done to make our vision a reality. Now more than ever our country needs our movement — our political revolution. As you have throughout this historic campaign, I ask for your ongoing support as we continue through the fall and beyond."}]
