If the pastor is wrong God will deal with him, it's not her place to do that. @username we don't know if he spoke to her privately & just because he rebuked her behavior doesn't mean it wasn't in love or that he doesn't love her. She may truly have been disrupting the services. God rebuked the behavior of many in the bible. The bible also says that God disciplines those he loves. No pastor is going to be able to preach in a way that makes everyone happy & making people happy isn't part of his job. He's supposed to preach the truth of God's word without compromise. His delivery can change, but the truth cannot.","commenter_a":"What kind of pastor throws out a 103 year old woman? Not even non-Christians would do this to an elderly woman. Madness. They hate her for believing the same doctrine that she learned at that church every Sunday for a century. The bible charges Christians to take care of the elderly and the widowed.","post_message":"Genora Biggs said that she and the current pastor, Rev.
