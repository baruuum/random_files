She has the nerve to keep getting mileage out of Trump's remarks about her looks. Google \"Fiorina Gaffe\". If the media hadn't kept that video \"under wraps\" while at the same time raking Trump over the coals for his remark, the whole flap about her face would have been a \"non\" issue. She also left her campaign for Senator 5 million in debt and her staffers high and dry.
