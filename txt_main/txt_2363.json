Socialism is when you have a garden with beautiful tomatoes and I, being too lazy to grow a garden, get my share of your tomatoes. Not because I deserve them, because the government said you have to give them. How ling do you think you will continue to grow that garden to feed my lazy butt? Socialism fails because the workers quit working also because there is no reward to their labor. The workers will become the lazy also and there will be no tomatoes. Figured I had better break it down to kindergarten level for you.","commenter_a":"If you support sanders, go live in Cuba.

Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? fair price for her? 3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24.

God created us ALL but the murderer was not created that way just as Homosexual was not either...a sin is a sin. The BIBLE is very clear in this. Sin is delighful & addictive & we tend to consume ourself in our sins hence why it's hard to detour ourself from sin...that's why we NEED Jesus Christ in our hearts. Jesus Christ was tempted in the dessert with everything you can think of yet he continued to tell Satan no & to flee. When Jesus was thirsty & hungry in the dessert & Satan tempted him with food & water He still said no. We have to do the same with temptation/sin. There is ALWAYS a way out of sin if we put ALL our faith/hope/strenth in Jesus Christ He will ...","post_message":"Trey Pearson, Christian Rock Star, Comes Out As Gay.
