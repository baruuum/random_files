They need to go back home where they belong to do this in their own country!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡","commenter_a":"If the Muslims choose t o.live here, Don' t tell us what you want. This is America and a lot of us are Christians and we don't need or want immigrants telling us to change our beliefs. If you don't like our beliefs and our freedoms, maybe you should g o back to you country and try to get along. If you choose to stay here and enjoy our life and freedoms, then stop telling us to give up.our beliefs. I suggest you join a branch of service and share the responsibility of living here instead of holding your hands out for every thing you can get for free. It's time we stand up to you and what you want. I'm tired of it. God bless America!!!!","post_message":"The want to change Easter in \"Spring Break\"..."},{"comment_id":"536259236580093","commenter_b":"STAY OUT OF OUR ELECTION!!!","commenter_a":"He is AFRAID VERY AFRAID !!","post_message":"What does this tell you?"},{"comment_id":"1234855006552733","commenter_b":"trump = sexual predator. You really feel ok getting behind this rapey racist creep? Wake up you ignorant fool!","commenter_a":"If you are a woman who is offended by what Donald Trump said a decade ago but you enjoyed 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and other movies and books like this than you are a hypocrite! Do you laugh when comedians talk like this or do you stand up and leave the room!?! I was not offended, I could care less what he said BS's with men in private - give me a break! I care about what he says and does now - I care about what he will do for our country! Look what Hillary did that mainstream media is covering up - her speeched released show she also refers to people as bucket of losers....has two different policies, one for public,one for private...not to mention the entire email scandal with her \"innocent\" friends all getting immunity...why do innocent people needimmunity?","post_message":"After audio was released of Donald J. Trump saying highly controversial things about women, Christian Coalition founder Ralph Reed shocked the media with a huge announcement on the Republican nominee.  Nobody saw this one coming... what do you think about what Reed said?"},{"comment_id":"895664467159698","commenter_b":"Elinor, cite your source. As recently as 2010, the Democrats made a former member of the KKK President pro Tempore of the Senate. Shawn, who these people may have voted for is irrelevant. A lot of Obama supporters are criminals. Does that mean they all are? Do you judge an entire group by the behavior of a few?","commenter_a":"I can explain it easily. THEY'RE NOT CONSERVATIVES!!! Liberals and conservatives aren't the only labels that exist to identify people. If you're claiming that they represent conservatives, you are at best, a cherry picker. But liar is the more appropriate label.","post_message":"Conservatives welcomed President Obama to Twitter in the only way they know how: By calling him a \"n*gger.\""},{"comment_id":"10154617717319255","commenter_b":"\"...ignorant and moronic assumption...\" \"...liberal mindset of free everything...\" I'll just leave that there where it belongs.","commenter_a":"I am a conservative who volunteers for children's charities, doesn't care if same sex couples marry, is pro-choice, owns a hand gun but doesn't believe any private citizen needs an Uzi, am a military spouse so obviously vehemently support our military (active and retired) and work in the public school system and believe those who work hard and succeed in high school deserve a break in college tuition. I'm sorry I don't fit in to your ignorant and moronic assumption that all conservatives are alike.","post_message":"Pretty much.   Thanks to Northern Michigan Progressives for sharing."},{"comment_id":"10154052672876051","commenter_b":"You deserve crooked Hillary!","commenter_a":"LMFAO, Clinton has SECURED enough electoral votes that she doesn't even NEED TO campaign anymore. Nice try there. It's pretty goddam pathetic that the absolute BEST the \"party of values\" could scrape up is a con artist who cheated on wife #1 with wife #2, has FIVE children from three different wives, wife #3 lied about having a degree and may possibly be an illegal immigrant; Trump appeared on the cover of Playboy and owned strip clubs AND gambling casinos; admits he wants to bang his own daughter; mocked the handicapped; supports torture; numerous business failures; bribed Florida AG Pam Bondi; is facing ethics lawsuit regarding Trump University, and that's just off the top of my head - yeah, right. Some \"Presidential\" material. So shove your fake-ass BULLSHIT stories about emails and Benghazi, you cheap phony \"patriots\" supporting Trump.","post_message":"Election swing: Donald Trump is now leading Hillary Clinton by two points in a major nationwide poll.

Shariah Law is dangerous, we support the patriots that stand against it.  Should Shariah be banned in all 50 states?"}]
