My local Old Navy had a perv filming a young girl while she was in a dressing room--her mother caught him in the act. These are not transgenders. These are simply perverted people! I am safer in a restroom with a transgender than I am with \"straight\" people! Transgenders are NOT peeping toms! If men dressing as women and claiming they are transgendered to assault little girls in bathrooms, then maybe there needs to be an anti-creepy men bill, not anti-LGBT bills, targeting Transgenders.","post_message":"Protesters inside North Carolina's statehouse staged symbolic sit-ins outside the offices of top legislative leaders."},{"comment_id":"602469266610319","commenter_b":"Your 15 mins of fame is running out!","commenter_a":"She needs help, yes.","post_message":"Sarah Palin was just hit with a massive curve ball, she needs your help.

I'll start respecting the blue more when the good ones start publicly, and loudly denouncing the ones who aren't.","post_message":"This officer had just finished a nice meal and was preparing to pay his bill when he noticed something written on the receipt."}]
