How can something that provides the best source of nutrients for a baby be considered too obscene to be observed in public where as men's which are just another body part be considered fine?! Free the nipple doesn't require a woman to bear all. I won't be, I've had no reason either functionally or otherwise to display mine in public (it's a bit cold in this part of the world) but my body is not obscene. I totally support the women doing this. If nipples are so provocative it's the sexualisation that society places on women not the female nipple owners that are the problem.","post_message":"\"It has to be said that, to the casual observer, the #FreeTheNipple campaign is a very confusing thing. Let‚Äôs just get this straight, one might say, it‚Äôs a feminist movement that encourages toplessness, and which has led to an Icelandic MP, respected as a serious parliamentarian, getting her boobs out for everyone to see.
