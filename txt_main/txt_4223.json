Mumford & Sons had nothing to do with THE CITIES/RESIDENTS. You can't blame a band for the amount of fans they attract, they're grammy award winning musciams coming of a 2 year hiatus after releasng a long awaited album. The city is the problem here for using this \"cleanout method\" which they are literally treating these people, HUMAN BEINGS, like trash and obviously have no problem using terms that state that. Blame the city not the band, oh and actually read the article.","post_message":"Not cool."},{"comment_id":"550509575137335","commenter_b":"So do it already arrest her corrupt ass because she is dangerous to our society.","commenter_a":"yeah...won't hold my breath !!

Leviticus 19:33-34 ESV “When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Before anyone starts screaming Old Testiment. Mark 12:30-31 (NIV) 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.”","post_message":"Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said his country  not pay for any wall, defying the claims U.S. President Donald Trump has made."}]
