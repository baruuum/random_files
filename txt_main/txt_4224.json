In Dallas most of those officers only had hand guns to defend theirselves and the innocent people! Their hand guns didn't reach the distance needed! Now, that's TENSION! You think it would be \"tension\" if your Police Officers were equipped properly in your city, but what would you do if this same thing happened in your city like it did in Dallas? Dont ever say it can't! The world is changing, wake up! It shows you do NOT have a son, brother, father, uncle or a good friend out there daily in a police uniform or you would want them protected!

The C Level staff walk away with millions and everyone else has to suck it up.","post_message":"What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he was going to stand up for working people it turns out that Wall Street and Goldman Sachs are still running the show - and the Trump administration. Among many other billionaires in the Trump administration is Gary D. Cohn, the departing president of Goldman Sachs and Trump's new director of the National Economic Council. Upon leaving Goldman Sachs, Cohn just received an exit package of $285 million. Yes, $285 million.  And that's how the rigged economy and oligarchy works. The middle class of this country bailed out Goldman Sachs to the tune of over $800 billion. Goldman Sachs paid a $5 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury for illegal activity, as did virtually every other major bank. Meanwhile, no top Wall Street executive is prosecuted for criminal activity. Instead, the president of Goldman Sachs becomes the leading financial adviser to the President. And, to add insult to injury, Cohn and the Trump administration will soon end up supporting huge tax breaks for the rich while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Can we stop them? Yes. But only through a powerful and focused grassroots movement which tells Congress to represent us all, not just the 1 percent."},{"comment_id":"936764406358981","commenter_b":"what tits. he was smelling her fart","commenter_a":"\"Joe stop staring at my tits, thanks.\" ~ Hillary","post_message":"Can you imagine?
