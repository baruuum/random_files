And guess what will happen? The ongoing trend. It get's worse and worse year after year. The debt keeps climbing, yet some have their blind folders on like they can't see this way of thinking, and the economy is constantly nose diving, we are constantly going further and further in debt. Another fact, we in the South are tired of pressing 1 to listen to English while we live in America. If Hillary had it her way before she goes to jail, the mid-west and North would be in the same situation after she let them flood in and gives them drivers license, you too would be having to Dial 1, every single time you want to hear English. Think it wouldn't bother you? Think again, you'll question whether you are really living in America.

The terror experienced in Paris for one night is what they go through on a day to day basis and you want to send them away?
