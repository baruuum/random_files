Hillary had an affair with Webb Hubbell who is the father of Chelsea. How could he then be this girl's father? A paternity test will answer the question.","post_message":"Teen girl comes forward at worst possible time. She just dropped a bombshell right in the Clinton's lap.

Because, you know what? Every time @username claims some stupid TV show will \"explode your brain,\" viewers barely end up with a BRAIN TWINGE. So instead of over-hyped praise, why don't you guys try something different? Something along the lines of: \"WE SAT THROUGH THE FIRST EPISODE OF ASH VS. EVIL DEAD AND WE DIDN'T GET CRAMPS IN OUR ASS.\" In short, Lower Expectations = More Pleasurable Viewing Experience. You're welcome!","post_message":"Ash vs Evil Dead is going to make your brain explode in the best way"}]
