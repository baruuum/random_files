Two years ago, I joined with officials from across our region as Caterpillar announced its intention to expand its footprint and keep its headquarters in Peoria – so this news comes as a shock. Our local economy is tied to the success of Caterpillar. My hope is that Caterpillar will keep the promise it made today for Peoria to remain its largest manufacturing site. I stand with all Peorians in expressing my deep disappointment with this decision."},{"comment_id":"10153507396631323","commenter_b":"She wears real fur....therefore she's a selfish bitch with no regard for the lives of others.
