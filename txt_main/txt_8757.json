As for your erroneous statement about the First Family's Christmas vacation, I will enlighten you as to the fact that other than Secret Service detail, they paid their own vacation expenses. The taxpayers always pick up the tab for security and use of Air Force One for ALL Presidents while they were in office. Now you go research!","post_message":"Republicans have only been in control for a week and already they are picking an unnecessary political fight that risks shutting down the Department of Homeland Security and endangering our security. Republicans should stop playing games and pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security because the pointless, political bill passed in the House today will not pass the Senate.   House Republicans voted to tear families apart and deport young people who came to this country as babies. Tearing families apart does nothing to secure our borders, fix our broken immigration system or strengthen our economy.   This is not a game and it is time for Republicans to take their responsibility to govern seriously, instead of playing to the most extreme voices in their party."},{"comment_id":"1080674971953513","commenter_b":"And then she has an ungrateful kid...
