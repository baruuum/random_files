Jeremy makes a legitimate point, and everyone attacks him because they don't like what he has to say, but he is totally right. Women like her don't need to have a victim mentality because she is more successful than the majority of men on this planet. Victim playing just holds people back and places limits on you before you even get started. Why not go out there, be confident, and refuse to let anything keep you from achieving your goals?","commenter_a":"Wealthy ladies are almost never feminists in actuality. They'll say they are because they need to in order to keep up a certain facade. But they've proven that women are able to be (more) successful and that most of the BS spouted by modern feminism is just that. It's not like someone's political views should matter anyway for the most part. Celebrities are human too.","post_message":"Marion Cotillard says she's not a feminist. Should we care?"}]
