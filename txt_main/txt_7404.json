Feminism should be about equality not about following one group of women's notion about what you should look, feel or talk like.","commenter_a":"I'm seeing a lot of diversity in the Muslim community about the concept of World Hijab Day (non-Muslim women wearing the hijab for a day in solidarity). Would love to get your thoughts on whether it's cultural appropriation, or upholding the more conservative aspects of your faith. I did participate last year, but not sure if I will again.","post_message":"Her \"Ask a Muslim\" booth was a huge success! - Parker Molloy"}]
