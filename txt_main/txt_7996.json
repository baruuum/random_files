A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? fair price for her? 3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. 4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? 5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath.

God created us ALL but the murderer was not created that way just as Homosexual was not either...a sin is a sin. The BIBLE is very clear in this. Sin is delighful & addictive & we tend to consume ourself in our sins hence why it's hard to detour ourself from sin...that's why we NEED Jesus Christ in our hearts. Jesus Christ was tempted in the dessert with everything you can think of yet he continued to tell Satan no & to flee. When Jesus was thirsty & hungry in the dessert & Satan tempted him with food & water He still said no. We have to do the same with temptation/sin. There is ALWAYS a way out of sin if we put ALL our faith/hope/strenth in Jesus Christ He will ...","post_message":"Trey Pearson, Christian Rock Star, Comes Out As Gay.

There are 50 muslim countries to accept muslim refugees!","commenter_a":"You know why I support the Syrian refugees coming to America? Because I'm not going to let the terrorists dictate my beliefs, ISIS doesn't scare me. What scares me is that we, Americans, are losing our sense of direction. I've thought about this refugee crisis for for quite some time now, if you don't believe me ask the Marines who I taught about the Syrian civil war in 2012. I've been aware of this conflict for quite awhile now, while the rest of the world turned a blind eye. Islamic extremists aren't going to scare me and they are not going to change my way of life or thinking. I am an American and I cower to nobody. When I see people fleeing danger I want to help, we as Americans want to help.
