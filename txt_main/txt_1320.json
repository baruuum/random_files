THE ESTABLISHMENT CRUZ WON'T BEAT HILLARY BECAUSE WE WON'T VOTE FOR HIM IF TRUMP DOES NOT WIN!!!","commenter_a":"America doesn't seem to understand if we don't fix our debt problem we won't have a country to fight over, the Chinese will be our legislators. If you think that's not possible, please read \"The war on Money\". Yes, as Christians, God wants us to fight for his truth. but we have to realize not one president in the history of our country has been able to legislate morality and it will not start with the next one. America has a satan problem, until we remove him from our hearts as a nation no matter who we place in office will be able to make lick-spit of difference. But one candidate, Trump, has a unique ability and agenda to repair the financial disaster created by the establishment. The same establishment that positioned Cruz and Rubio as candidates. Cruz and Rubio are puppets of the RNC establishment! They owe people favors ...","post_message":"Tremendous news."},{"comment_id":"1094342837275269","commenter_b":"She ain't coming back","commenter_a":"I love Jessica Lange","post_message":"Jessica Lange announced that four seasons of 'American Horror Story' was enough and she will not return.

Switzerland has a population of 8 million people, according to Trump's plan, he would deport the equivalent of every single person living in Switzerland and then SOME not only it is CRAZY, it's impossible. ..for the sake of argument let's say it was possible, it would cost billions and billions of dollars and take decades to accomplish that.","commenter_a":"I think people are going to vote donald trump for president","post_message":"Saying goodbye to some of my great workers at Trump National Doral Miami."}]
