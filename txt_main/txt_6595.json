Game over.","commenter_a":"@username, President Obama has only threatened Veto if the try to screw his Immigration E.O.s, which by the way are Constitutional, your party is still playing their very dangerous game of obstructing everything President Obama does. As for your erroneous statement about the First Family's Christmas vacation, I will enlighten you as to the fact that other than Secret Service detail, they paid their own vacation expenses. The taxpayers always pick up the tab for security and use of Air Force One for ALL Presidents while they were in office. Now you go research!","post_message":"Republicans have only been in control for a week and already they are picking an unnecessary political fight that risks shutting down the Department of Homeland Security and endangering our security. Republicans should stop playing games and pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security because the pointless, political bill passed in the House today will not pass the Senate.   House Republicans voted to tear families apart and deport young people who came to this country as babies. Tearing families apart does nothing to secure our borders, fix our broken immigration system or strengthen our economy.   This is not a game and it is time for Republicans to take their responsibility to govern seriously, instead of playing to the most extreme voices in their party."},{"comment_id":"909813239056017","commenter_b":"And ya wonder why his kids are so messed up...duh. apple doesn't fall far from the tree.","commenter_a":"Who cares, ?","post_message":"\"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self.\""},{"comment_id":"606850699417060","commenter_b":"What a pussy","commenter_a":"Remember these Libatards,I never forget !","post_message":"List Of 31 Democrats Who Will Be Giving Netanyahu The Middle Finger, SKIPPING His Speech â‹† UFP NEWS... @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1027028344015468","commenter_b":"Then slapped it in the face with my dick","commenter_a":"But if it was an Airman that got jumped the Marines would be applauded.","post_message":"We're on the look out for two scum bags who jumped a Phantom Fury vet in a case of mistaken stolen valor.
