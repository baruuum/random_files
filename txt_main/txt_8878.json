The email makes readily apparent that the military was prepared to launch immediate assistance. The fact that the Obama administration withheld this email for so long only worsens the scandal of Benghazi.

The ODD Relationship (do I say \"Love Affair\") between ISLAM and LIBERALISM is a WEIRD thing to watch. HELLO!! Liberal FEMINIST Women!! Islam is a SEXIST Male Dominated, Woman TRASHING \"Religion\"!! Liberals MOCK, RIDICULE Christianity, then turn around and Protect Islam's 1400 Year \"War on Women\" which Treats women like Chattel, and Stones Women to DEATH for adultery. \"Honor Kills\" women when their men feel their women aren't obedient, Muslim MEN FORCE Women into castration, Slavery, to wear scarves, and Burkas!! Muslim Women aren't allowed to Drive and be Educated yet Liberals want to be \"tolerant\" to Islam, but want Christianity to CHANGE!!?? Oh, and GAYS end up on the wrong side of the Stones/BladesToo!!","commenter_a":"Thank you President Obama. I'm so glad I'm not a pussy like most of the commenters here that live in fear of the great big scary Muslims. It must suck to go to bed at night clinging to their guns and religion wetting their pants afraid that Muslims are coming to kill their family. I'm glad I have a president that rises above that childish fear. I'm blessed that God hasn't made me a coward like so many of my countrymen who would gladly trade their freedoms for the veined vail of security. Cowards all of you. And I already know their response. They will call me a delusional libtard that loves Muslims. Without realizing the irony that these were the same people that called white civil rights activists \"n***ger lovers\". This generation of dolts, will too, be wiped away with time.","post_message":"“It was so moving for Michelle and myself in part because it was so representative of the country. You had people from every background, every faith,” President Barack Obama  said after meeting the families of San Bernardino victims.  “Some described their loved ones who had come to this country as immigrants; others who had lived in the area all their lives — all of them extraordinarily proud of the work they were doing to keep people healthy and safe here in this community.”"},{"comment_id":"575299862633901","commenter_b":"@username if he just fired all the illegals that work him would be a start.

What gives you the right to choose for anyone? What's next? Fat people can't wear bathing suits? Pretty girls have to wear short skirts? No one... NO ONE has the right to decide what someone wears. Change laws to promote freedom. Let them choose. Don't choose for them. Clothing doesn't oppress any more than guns shoot people. People oppress. Change that.","commenter_a":"It oppresses women. Before everyone says it's s their religion, it was taught to them by a man. And yes all religions use other ways to oppress women that should stop as well. I always find it odd that people champion the right form them to \"choose \" what oppression the want to follow.","post_message":"A new country is debating banning burqas."},{"comment_id":"1297864100266083","commenter_b":"She is yuck.
