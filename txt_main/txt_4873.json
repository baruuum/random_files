I'm pretty sure they were taken there and didn't voluntarily have themselves incarcerated. Don't say it's impossible. That said, I think it's improbable and impractical to plan on finding 12 million illegal immigrants as a whole and deport them. Just let them remain illegal and deport them as you find them. Let them stand in line with everybody else who is attempting to immigrate LEGALLY.","commenter_a":"I think lots of them will self deport. Especially those who are gang members and have been deported and came back illegally. Cut off benefits and the free loaders will leave.

Mike Flynn topped out at 24 days before resigning last night.

That relationship could become the subject of investigation in Congress ‚Äî at least one Republican, Marco Rubio, wants more information and has suggested combining it with a broader investigation into Russian meddling.
