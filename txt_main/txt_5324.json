The Ukraine government was propped up by the Russian government at the time Manafort was dealing with them. It was Russian/Soviet Union weaponry that took the life of a cousin in Vietnam. I'm a veteran from the Reagan era and broke out in a cold sweat every time general quarters was sounded thinking Russia/Soviet Union had finally attacked us. From the day I first opened my eyes Russia/Soviet Union was my country's enemy. Today's Russian government mirrors the government of my former enemy and the GOP candidate praises their leadership and hints that we should crawl in bed with them...I THINK NOT!!!!!","commenter_a":"Well, this is not news; Dumbocrats support rigged elections not the popular support.
