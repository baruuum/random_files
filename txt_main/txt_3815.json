The terror experienced in Paris for one night is what they go through on a day to day basis and you want to send them away? Have some empathy, what if it was you and your child fleeing this barbarism? Turning them away is no better than away Jewish refugees during WW2 (see SS St. Louis).

The fact that students were allowed to carry may explain how the shooter got to the classroom carrying a long gun without being stopped.
