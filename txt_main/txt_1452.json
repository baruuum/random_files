The woman is CHEATING. She's actually bussing mentally deficient people to the polls to vote for her! She and Bill are colluding to steal elections by interfering with voters at the polls! She is so despicable, and frankly, anyone who knows about this stuff and supports her anyway DESERVES a Trump presidency.","commenter_a":"(DISCLAIMER: YES I VOTED FOR BERNIE IN THE PRIMARY. THE FOLLOWING POST CONCERNS A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION WHERE HILLARY IS THE NOMINEE) To the Hillary bashers, you do realize that she is ideologically identical to Bill Clinton and almost identical to Obama, right? If you found those presidencies to be solid, ok, or even mediocre, that is a hell of a lot better than the potential authoritarian nightmare we have coming with a Trump presidency or republican control of all of government (see Kansas or Louisiana for what happens when the tea party can do whatever they want unchecked). And yes, again, I voted for Bernie in the primary.","post_message":"One thing is certain: While I’m excited to cast my vote for Bernie Sanders next month, I’ll be more than ready to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton in November."},{"comment_id":"1069935306362850","commenter_b":"Wooh, I guess different strokes for...that's one ugly woman","commenter_a":"Carly not bad to the eye that's all","post_message":"Carly ROASTED Hillary over her email scandal!
