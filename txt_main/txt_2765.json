Amid major backlash, T.I., issued an apology for his sexist comments.

She doesn't even pay equal to men in her own foundation and campaign. Bernie's \"socialist destination\" is s fulfillment of FDR's vision. Hillary will fulfill the Koch brothers and Walton family's vision. I don't revere poverty, nor do I support buying an election and using electoral fraud to gain office. No, Bernie won't \"part the Red Sea,\" but the electorate he is inspiring will effect a revolution.","commenter_a":"It seems to me that the Super Bernie people are caught up in useless passion over issues that are neither new or original. I distinctly recall when Mrs. Clinton went to capital hill and pitched for universal healthcare on live television. She was eaten alive, but she stood her ground as she has on the grassroots level many many times. She's always been there for women especially where wages were concerned. And there is so much more. Mr. Sanders is not a bad person but it is a bit disinginuous to ride the democratic train to get to a socialistic destination. It's also unfair to insist that anyone who has made the system work for them is a bad person. Bernie is no more deserving of reverence for the money he doesn't have than Hillary for the money she does have. She worked for hers' and he worked for his. ...","post_message":"Time to unify the party."},{"comment_id":"960942283946630","commenter_b":"and the worse thing is, women are doing the cutting. sick sick sick","commenter_a":"horrible","post_message":"Female genital mutilation is a human rights violation.
