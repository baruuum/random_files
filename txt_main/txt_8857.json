You realise Germany is one of the most successful countries in the world right? In terms of GDP, growth, economic viability, social mobility, lower wealth inequality, higher math and literacy, better education, lower incarceration and homicide rates, lower obesity, drug and alcohol addiction etc etc. If being among the top few countries in the world for such things is \"ruined\", you clearly don't know the meaning of the word. Put aside the right wing and sensationalist news outlets for a moment, who's job it is to highlight every transgression of migrants and Muslims, in order to make things seem much worse than they actually are, and instead take a minute to appreciate just how successful and dominant Germany is right now. Merkel is smart, she knows migration is the key to economic growth and sustainability, even if it has some negative byproducts. ...","commenter_a":"Merkel has not only ruined Germany with her idiotic open door fantasies, she has caused havoc for the rest of Europe.

It makes me wonder how many thin bags it takes to make up one of those. Then how many if those are just thrown out because they become dirty or torn. Plus, as it was stated, the carbon footprint of these bags isn't helping anything. I think the best solution might be bags made biodegradable from corn or potato. I've seen some restaurants begin using those.","commenter_a":"when you walk a beach every day, as i do in seattle, it is clear that limiting the use of plastic bags is completely reasonable.","post_message":"Ah, the infamous \"paper or plastic\" question.
