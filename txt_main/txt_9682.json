Please.","commenter_a":"I hope you all understand that because the prosecutor went for a murder charge, this officer will be found not guilty. One, due to the fact that the prosecution will have to prove that an on duty officer was out there to kill someone, which won't happen. Two, for the fact that a vehicle is a deadly weapon and shooting a suspect using a vehicle in a manner that puts an officers life in danger is standard procedure and is taught in every academy in the U.S. This was a good shoot and the officer will be exonerated. But get ready to torch your local cvs for justice.","post_message":" is without question a murder, the prosecutor said about Sam Dubose's death.  didn do anything violent toward the officer. He wasn dragging him. And [the officer] pulled out his gun and shot him in the head."},{"comment_id":"1195945367091729","commenter_b":"Totally unacceptable. They should be arrested. Deport.

Probably a lot more than the wall and the homeless combined. Let's take care of Americans and America's needs FIRST!! After we take care of our Veterans, our homeless, our children and build the wall we can consider helping those that want to come here legally!! Resources should not be going to illegals until all Americans are taken care of.","commenter_a":"I can buy a candy bar for a dollar or give the dollar to a homeless person. Wait!
