I also sent e-mails to my congressman and both senators and signed a petition about the same issue. I suspect that the motivation is simply that the government doesn't want those who own ARs to have a source of reasonably priced ammo for their guns. I oppose this mindset.","post_message":"A notice from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) shows the agency is considering a ban on the popular M855 AR-15 round  by re-categorizing the round as  piercing.  Be sure to contact ATF and let them know you oppose this proposal. Then contact your members of Congress and express your opposition to ATF's ammo ban.  @webpagelink/ #M855"},{"comment_id":"1016134698454262","commenter_b":"She'll just speak to someone else.
