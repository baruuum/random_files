The Pooch Hotel Hollywood representatives initially told the dog's owner that Boggs was taken to a vet as a precaution after an altercation, according to the owner's roommate. About 45 minutes later, an ER vet called to say the puppy was in critical condition with a torn trachea and multiple internal injuries.   Described as \"13 pounds of pure joy,\" Boggs was put down as her out-of-town owner listened helplessly on the phone. Now she is considering legal action.
