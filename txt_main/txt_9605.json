Most illegals work in Agriculture, and farmers said they don't want them removed. I don't think illegals are our problem. They pay billions each year in taxes. For example, food, sales, telecommunications, cable, transtportation, gas, etc. If we got rid of them, we would lose in the end no matter how many jobs we would get in industries that don't require I-9s.","commenter_a":"It's sad, heartbreaking, and demoralizing to people on that side of town that have tried to do anything to help curb the problems. The answer is not to make the situation worse by closing the store. The store is the lone grocery story on that side of town @username. That is not going to help. The solution is to deal with the poverty on that side of town. People steal and rob and sell drugs for economic reasons. They are broke basically. That's why on the Westside the BP got robbed by the White lady. She was broke, and she committed an armed robbery because she got desperate and didn't know what else to do.

The problem with America is Americans. STOP TRYING TO SHOVE YOUR OPINION ON EVERYONE, just because you don't like what they do doesn't make them wrong.

You believe in shoving your opinion down the throats of everyone.","post_message":"â€œI donâ€™t even think the song should be our national anthem, because itâ€™s a racist song.\""}]
