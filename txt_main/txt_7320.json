Now, go get 'em.","commenter_a":"Choice satellite TV doesn't show FOX NEWS anymore so I don't get to see it. All we get is liberal news and I think this is just propaganda and time to cancel choice for violation of our contract.","post_message":"This evening I wanted to share with you some news that is very personal to me.  Because you have been such a good friend and a strong supporter of all my efforts, I wanted you to know first that tonight I will do more than just say goodnight on my Fox show.  I will say goodbye.  This is the last edition of Huckabee on the Fox News Channel. It has been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasn¹t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.  There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President.  I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support.  As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to leave a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America.  I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"},{"comment_id":"10153366334404024","commenter_b":"I don't trust anything that Obama says or does.","commenter_a":"Get him for war crimes.","post_message":"Doctors Without Borders Rejects Obama’s Apology: Demand Investigation Into What It Said Was An Alleged “War Crime” @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154459292584138","commenter_b":"Right!!!","commenter_a":"What about bengizi, emails, her picks for judges, say goodbye to our Constitution, and gun rights, i could go on and on.
