You should go there when you get tired of working. Many of our jails are full of illegal immigrants waiting to be deported or just released back into society. You should really think before you open you mouth Mario. Some people are just plane dumb. To think jail or prison is a vacation. If we sent home the illegal immigrants that are currently in our jail system, we could close 20% of our jails and put that money to better use.","commenter_a":"More people would have been there but it was morning and they were sleeping. It's also not the 1st or 15th so they don't have their free government checks, so no gas to get there. I say deport them, if they are here illegally they need to go. I'm tired of paying tax for them to get a free ride. We don't even take care of our own vets as well as we take care of illegal immigrants. That's a bunch of bull.","post_message":"Immigration policy protests continued throughout the morning in downtown LA, forcing closures at Los Angeles and Main streets.
