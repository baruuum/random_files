What he should have pushed on and pushed really hard are three things. First, he should have looked directly into the camera and said, \"Mrs Clinton has said over and over that she is infinitely more qualified than I to be Commander in Chief. She could not and actually would not protect four lives let alone 320 million. Do YOU trust her with your lives and those of your children? Mrs Clinton has said over and over that she understands the plight of the inner cities and has worked hard to erase the despair that exists in our minority communities. Tell me, Chicago, Baltimore, East Saint Louis, and every other inner city, this woman has had nearly thirty years to help you and other than pander for your vote, exactly what has she done and are your lives better? And lastly, Mrs Clinton has ...","post_message":"The 1st presidential debate in 90 seconds.  Who do you think won – Hillary Clinton or Donald J.

How can something that provides the best source of nutrients for a baby be considered too obscene to be observed in public where as men's which are just another body part be considered fine?! Free the nipple doesn't require a woman to bear all. I won't be, I've had no reason either functionally or otherwise to display mine in public (it's a bit cold in this part of the world) but my body is not obscene. I totally support the women doing this. If nipples are so provocative it's the sexualisation that society places on women not the female nipple owners that are the problem.","post_message":"\"It has to be said that, to the casual observer, the #FreeTheNipple campaign is a very confusing thing. Let’s just get this straight, one might say, it’s a feminist movement that encourages toplessness, and which has led to an Icelandic MP, respected as a serious parliamentarian, getting her boobs out for everyone to see.
