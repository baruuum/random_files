To my mind she's a big pile of ***t,...bring your own shovel. No need to place her in an urn or other bucket-like container, just toss it in with the other compost and let her continue to decompose.","commenter_a":"I've seen a number of articles on \"alternative\" news sites claiming wikileaks is falsifying all this stuff. Kind of sad that people would go so far to bury their heads in the sand rather than even consider the thought that a candidate which rigged a primary is capable of so much more. #HillaryforPrison","post_message":"The sheer number of insults in the email trove has left the Clinton campaign unable or unwilling to respond."},{"comment_id":"10153244727383352","commenter_b":"such a bitch whore ,","commenter_a":"And In \"Other Breaking News...\" Kim Kardashian is laughing all the way to the bank! !","post_message":"Kim Kardashian gets slammed on Twitter for her new Super Bowl T-Mobile ad where she shows off her body while taking selfies"},{"comment_id":"1106079576120034","commenter_b":"Islam believe in cuting off heads and raping children.","commenter_a":"Ali didn't want to because it was supposedly against his religion, Islam!

Focus on the team, the stands, and the rest of the stadium and to hell with him. If everyone stops making him big news, maybe we can all go back to watching football and the rest of the players on the field. Make him prove he even deserves to be out there, and sorry 49er fans, but before all this crap by him became news, I couldn't even tell you who he was. Maybe this is his way of getting some publicity because he ain't no Tom Brady or Peyton Manning!!!
