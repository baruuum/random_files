It'd better not be, since Trump has a habit of declaring bankruptcy...and that's not an option for the country. Sure, he's rich. However, he STARTED really rich and would be about as wealthy now or even more so if he didn't go into business at all, based on average stock market gains. @webpagelink/ With his unwillingness to release his tax returns and his inability have to have a serious discussion of policy, beyond 140-character tweets and repetition of: \"tremendous\", \"problems\", \"so many people tell me\", \"better deals\", and \"believe me\", Trump is most certainly NOT qualified for the job.","post_message":"\"I feel Mr. Trump can come and get us better deals.
