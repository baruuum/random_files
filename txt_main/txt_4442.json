Clinton's big victory in NY is not the result of some sort of conspiracy. It is a result of counting the votes. I am not one of the \"Bernie or Bust\" people. Trump/Cruz are too dangerous to advocate some sort of 3d party campaign where Bernie is the candidate. When Ralph Nader took votes away from Al Gore, it resulted in George W. I do not want a rerun of that movie. I am not happy about how the race seems to have ended, but, Hillary got more votes than Bernie and that ends it.","post_message":"Hillary Clinton gets emotional telling the story of Sandy Hook Elementary principal Dawn Hochsprung, whose daughter is at the victory rally."},{"comment_id":"1739139336348305","commenter_b":"My thoughts are she need to shut up!
