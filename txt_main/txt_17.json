Nothing's going to change my mind or anyone else's. The one thing that all of you had in common before today is that Hillary already had you fooled. It's not working on the rest of us, so sit back and enjoy the next four years that not only I know is coming, but SHE CLEARLY KNOWS IS COMING, hence the grasping at straws that we are witnessing this morning.","commenter_a":"It's hard to distinguish between the most rotten pile of trash this morning! You have: -the \"accusers\", who have remained silent throughout the whole campaign until Andy Cooper asked a question that, in his coke-addled and cock-obsessed mind, he thought would surely win him a Pulitzer. -the Clintons. ('Nuff said) -the MSM thinking that we'd all just magically buy this crap. Don't be fooled, America. You see the direction that they are bending over backwards to point you in. Vote Trump and let them know that you're not going to stand for it any longer!","post_message":"A woman alleges she was raped by Donald J.
