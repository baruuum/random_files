Lots of racist people giving them dirty looks in Europe.","commenter_a":"Europe should consider making a deal with Greece rather then Turkey who is playing its proxy war over Refugee crisis.. European Parliament Greece is honesty and has no evil or greed sort of motive behind this cause. They can handle refugees better then turkey. Who by the way is taking advantage of the European Parliament by making a deal and asking a free hand to strike and bomb Kurds who are basically fighting ISIS which turkey is making it hard for kurds by attacking them and making it easy for ISIS to freely invade other save areas of Iraq and Syria..","post_message":"'People detained on Lesbos and Chios have virtually no access to legal aid, limited access to services and support, and hardly any information about their current status or possible fate'"},{"comment_id":"10156674955065354","commenter_b":"Win by selling out our principles ?

I translate that into, we will not get rid of our free labor (slaves) so secession was the choice, I can see where economics played into it, but to say slavery was not part of those same economics would be terribly ignorant. Lincoln maintained that secession was illegal thus unless south gave in war was inevitable.","commenter_a":"Here is an explanation of the civil war directly from the FEDERAL Government which proves without doubt that the War was NOT about slavery.

He is the real criminal, he committed fraud, his involved with Putin and hacking the election in his favor, he refuses to show his taxes because he probably commited fraud if he doesn't have anything to hide then he should show his taxes. He did not put his businesses in a blind trust he continues to profit from his businesses while his in office. He hasn't paid taxes in over 20 years you Trumpeters created this monster by continuesly supporting him now his out of control.","post_message":""}]
