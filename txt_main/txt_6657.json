YAY Bernie for doing what you did, now solidify the party, tell your supporters to support Hillary and then we can all go forward to enihilating trump and winning the presidency. Your Elizabeth Warren can still BE the VP candidate and together the women can set the world on fire and win... America is ready for this..
