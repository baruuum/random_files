They are American born and home grown terrorists that are mainly one demographic. Trump and his supporters are jokes. Trump is ALWAYS putting himself in the news. EVERY time he opens his mouth his words will be scrutinized. Trump can always dish it out but HE can't take it. Presidential candidates aren't suppose to be whiners. I hope he and the Republican party go down in flames. Most of the Republican party is spineless and/or ignorant to have the guts to publicly stand up to Trump when he's wrong. So they defend him instead. Trump is a liar and dangerous! He's the KING of denial and deflection. His goal is to divide and conquer through fear and hate. We can't let them win! WE CAN'T IGNORE the fact that the Republican platform is that ANYONE ...","post_message":"The former New York City mayor introduced Donald J.

Giseleangelique D, 47, of Thousand Oaks allegedly sought out young mothers under the guise of a charitable organization looking for women with 1 to 2-month-old infants to assist.  That's how D found Eliza Delacruz, police say. She allegedly stalked the infant's mother and then had a co-conspirator snatch the child. Three other people were also arrested in the alleged plot, which includes an attack on another mother and child in El Segundo.   What investigators say they can't figure out is why 3-week-old Eliza was killed.
