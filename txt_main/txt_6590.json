The conclusion runs counter to a popular narrative suggesting that immigrants take the jobs of U.S. citizens."},{"comment_id":"519371271599548","commenter_b":"He did not mention deporting a large number of illegals, he did not mention anything about building walls, that's why he failed to stop the influx of illegal immigrants that we have now. Nothing is impossible, if we want to do it. If we can dig tunnels below, we can build walls above.","commenter_a":"It doesn't sound like trump at all. That's most probably what trump should have said. Everything bill Clinton said has been implemented. He doesn't mention deporting 12 million people (impossible to execute), he doesn't mention building a wall (idiotic and impossible to execute)... So no, doesn't sound like trump at all. This sounds like someone that actually has a executable plan, unlike trump. Not to mention calling a whole nation rapists, murders and drug dealers.","post_message":"Do you think this sounds a lot like Donald J. Trump?

BIRDS of FEATHER, flock TOGETHER!","commenter_a":"My message to these \"journalists\". I don't care if you're talking about Trump, Obama, Clinton, or aliens. Using that kind of language is a disgrace to your job, which you obviously don't deserve. Your blatant disregard for any kind of integrity obliterates any credibility or respect you had with me. If you expect people to listen to you, make your use of language worth listening to or find another career that better employs your lack of ethics, if such a thing exists. Good luck with that.","post_message":"If a journalist said this about Barack Obama, the collective outrage from the press could be measured on the Richter scale."},{"comment_id":"1196725563700232","commenter_b":"You left out the part where Trump plans on cutting taxes on the most wealthy as well., Then there are Trump plans for how trade with China and Mexico is going to be handled, yet even now all the products that bear Trumps name are being manufactured in China and Mexico. Perhaps to show he is working in good faith, don't you think he should have them manufactured here in the US? It is quite simple to say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that but it is far more difficult to actually do them. He might say it, if elected he might try and do it but I guarantee you he is not going to \"make\" the Mexicans pay for his wall, a wall that will actually do little to stop the flow of illegals. The gun he will hold to the Mexicans head to make ...","commenter_a":"Trump wants to build a wall on the border and make Mexico pay for it, deport illegals, cut taxes on the middle class and corporations, destroy Isis, take care of our veterans, strengthen our military, build the keystone pipeline, repeal Common Core, repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market based system, stop SS and welfare fraud, fight Mexico and China unfair trade and currency practices, preserve the sanctity of the unborn life, preserve the sanctity of the 2nd amendment ... that's conservatism ... that's patriotism ... that's what it will take to bring America back to greatness","post_message":"Take a look at the companies that are partnering with this pro-amnesty open-borders group!   @webpagelink"}]
