Always seems to be when there is a \"Political\" issue, Ferguson-illegal aliens, Baltimore- Clinton Foundation and the very questionable donations. Of course the nuke treaty with Iran, etc.! Protesters in both cities started out fairly calm. Then hordes of people started pouring out of the woodwork, looting, burning, destroying, many were not even from that area!
