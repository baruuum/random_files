Other then the fact she was shot! She should be fined and her gun license stripped until she completes a gun safety class! Even if she attended one in the first place to own her guns. She obviously wasn't paying attention when the part of trigger locks was brought up! But sadly she will probably not have to change anything about the way she practices gun safety and I'm sorry but that's wrong! Again she's lucky the kid didn't blow its own face off! I really think we should be able to own guns but not if you're not responsible about it!

The immigration process can always be improved but, to give out amnesty to the illegals is like saying don't worry about the long waits in line; hundreds of dollars spent on forms; and the months it takes to swear in as a US citizen. If illegal immigrants want amnesty then pick a number; pay a penalty, and follow the process including all the fees. People who are following the rules are deeply wronged by illegals jumping the line by receiving amnesty.","commenter_a":"God Bless Donald Trump as he is our next real President.","post_message":"Press Conference LIVE"},{"comment_id":"10153642525234411","commenter_b":"Para estar en un paisaje tan encantador vale la pena.","commenter_a":"PROOF THAT RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN UKRAINE @webpagelink","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154361925736336","commenter_b":"@username Post the video of your interview with Dr. Jasser!","commenter_a":"Thank you President Obama for speaking up on this issue.
