How did that workout... Detroit was setup as the model city.. As was Baltimore and Chicago... In reality, all the democrats did was move the blacks from the southern plantations to the Urban Plantations and laugh as they did it!! Here is the quote from LBJ as he did this: \"These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference... I'll have them niggers voting Democratic ...","commenter_a":"Blame it on anyone else but your OWN failed policies, GOP.","post_message":"The conservative blame game is in full effect."},{"comment_id":"1607872669509039","commenter_b":"All those white people in the crowd.

I have never met the families that need their child taken. All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first. When you take children from their homes, good or bad homes, put them in counseling. Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."}]
