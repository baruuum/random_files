When you factor out people from the laws, you create an inequity that needs to be handled as Solomon did --- One case at a time. Many years of productive residency DOES erase the fruit of the poisoned tree --- that she came here against a statuary law. Laws were made to cope with inequity. We have immigration laws because we feared overpopulation by the poorest people in the world who would want to come to the \"land of opportunity.\" But, when someone comes and contributes to our fabric, we need to weigh that against a rule made to prevent, in her case, something that doesn't exist.","commenter_a":"The first step in holding conservative views on immigration is that they can't view anyone who might be affected by bad immigration policy as fully human. That's the problem.

Fact is she would have already packed up her tent and left town to sell more books if this was 't Donald frigging Trump she was running against? That's something to be proud of? The second worst? You see that's where a candidate needs to be a good candidate to get my vote. In my book she's not, if your Presidential standards are that much lower, ok, vote for her. Mine aren't.","commenter_a":"Sorry Bernie, but I can't sit here and watch you degrade yourself into just another shill for her. You used to hate what she stands for. Now you endorse it.

The only effect of this ruling is to delay justice for thousands of families in Nevada and across the country. Governors, mayors and law enforcement officers have emphasized that these programs are good public policy, help our economy and keep our communities safe.  Courts are only involved in the first place because Republicans have spent years blocking Congress from fixing our broken immigration system. Congress should live up to its responsibility and pass an immigration bill that secures our borders, keeps families together and provides an earned path to citizenship.  There is nothing stopping the Senate from debating immigration legislation immediately. Unfortunately, the Senate is mired in a completely avoidable impasse over funding the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats have a simple solution for getting out of this jam: take up and pass a clean bill to fund Homeland Security, then move on to a robust debate on immigration legislation.  Democratsâ€™ offer to first fund Homeland Security and then debate immigration stands. All Republicans have to do is say yes."},{"comment_id":"1806555102961372","commenter_b":"Why does she keep bringing up controversy. Be done with it Megan!

I've received a few boo's for my stance on Trump and I just have to say this so I hope you will take just a moment and read it to the end. And I say this as no response with no judgement or ill will toward anyone. I understand there are many who feel Trump's brashness doesn't qualify him for office. I agree he does need some polishing in some of his mannerisms. However, God willing, I will vote for him because this country is so far gone now and into the sewer so DEEP that I doubt there is much that will help it recover. That is why I feel more strongly about this now than perhaps ever in my lifetime that we M-U-S-T elect a strong, no-nonsense, straight-shooter with a BACKBONE OF STEEL who will stand up for ...","post_message":"realdonaldtrump is the first presidential candidate in 2016 to reach 1MM Instagram followers.
