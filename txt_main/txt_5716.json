WE have been saying this is going to be a problem here. we already have too many whack a do 's to deal with, and letting people who have an intense hate for a certain segment of our society in to this country with NO understanding of our population and LAWS other than it picks up the tab, is a recipe for this very thing. But IS NOT a good enough reason to give up my gun rights. I will just cling to my weapon and bible thank you very much. gay people everywhere should understand this now, weather it's a gun or a bomb, you are on their hit list.","post_message":"Speechless."},{"comment_id":"10153515991569087","commenter_b":"Good.

I like Mrs. Fiorina,I think she is brilliant, but she didnt get enough supporters. Sorry for that cause I think she would be a great first woman president. However, we have to end with an electable candidate that will beat the demo candidate, cause we dont need another Obama presidency.
