Do you support revoking her benefits?"},{"comment_id":"10155453199626729","commenter_b":"Illegal immigrants big issue here too, handing out drivers licenses that look identical doesn't help with the voter fraud issue we definitely have, but don't acknowledge.","commenter_a":"We have the same problem in Nevada. My guess would be 25% of the plates are Californian, maybe an exaggeration, but at least 10-15% are, and these aren't tourists because they're parked and driving out in our neighborhoods. These are just the ones that haven't bothered to register their cars here. Overwhelming people you talk to are Californians and most have come within the last 5-10 years. Majority of true Nevadans, natives and long time residents, are embarrassed by the color our state was on that election map. I wish the infestation would retreat to their looney state but it appears we've been overrun.","post_message":"So simple, a liberal could understand it"},{"comment_id":"10153509190373132","commenter_b":"Let her die with respect!!!","commenter_a":"I'm all for it I had to watch my husband die stage four brain Cancer that spread to all organs and bones to see him in so much pain and high doses of morphine to watch what he went through and reading about Brittany I say go for it the right to die with dignity God bless my heart goes out to you and all of you that are going through hell","post_message":"\"I can't wait.

It is Planned parenthood that started with the concept to murder black babies before they were born.","commenter_a":"Aren't the Democrats responsible for the initial abortion idea and practice?

Don't kid yourself Mitchell. The difference is that we would take up arms to protect the land by preventing poaching, over-grazing and unsustainable resource extraction, whereas these fucks want unregulated access to sensitive ecosystems.","commenter_a":"Oregon is an open carry state. These Militia men aren't doing anything wrong. The BLM outpost is on public property and was unlocked. There was no violent takeover.
