End of that discussion. With that said, I sincerely hope Carson never holds any public office at this stage of his life due to what appears to be his deteriorating mental faculties.

This recent tack she has made Insisting that the Democratic party MUST Permanently Give Up on things like Universal Health Care, drug reform, campaign reform, college access, and essentially Everything that Really Matters to ME as a voter has Convinced me that I CANNOT - under Any Circumstances pledge My Vote for her.
