You sound just like these ignorant people who always got something to say behind closed doors. I guess you wouldn't know about white supremacy because you've bought in to this bs white people have taught you in America. I guess all the killings by white police is something new. You have no idea what it's like to be black and to get even immigrants being racist towards you the same immigrants Martin Luther ...","post_message":"The Debt Collection Industry Is the Epitome of Systematic Racism"},{"comment_id":"10153851827136336","commenter_b":"Deport.
