Instigators to anti-police sentiment? Comments like Paul's are simply deniers to the findings of two separate independent investigations that produced identical findings. That is, Brown never had his hands up, was never surrendering and he was the aggressor.","post_message":"The Justice Department has finally confirmed what many of us were certain was the case: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told the truth about what happened when he said he shot Michael Brown in self-defense. After a six-month investigation, the DOJ concluded that Brown, allegedly a thug and a thief, was not trying to peacefully surrender when the incident occurred. He did not hold his hands up and say, “Don’t shoot.” And he was not shot in the back, as some alleged. @webpagelink"}]
