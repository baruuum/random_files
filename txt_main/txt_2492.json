I’m proud that our nation acted during that crisis to take in refugees, but I remain motivated by the knowledge that we could have done much, much more. The Statue of Liberty isn’t engraved with do not enter signs, it is proudly emblazoned with ‘give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.’ This is a quintessential American value and though we’ve not always lived up to our ideals, the President would do well to remember that we cannot afford to turn our backs on them, especially today—Holocaust Remembrance Day.   We are a nation that leads with strength—a nation that knows ‘the only thing we have to fear is fear itself’—not a nation that cowers in fear when faced with difficult choices. The America that I know is not one that slams its doors on families and children fleeing barbarism and terror, but one that shines brightly as a beacon of hope for all human beings. Giving in to our fears, as the President has done, is not the action of a strong country. Today’s order will ultimately serve to weaken our own national security, playing into our enemy’s hands and helping convince another generation of young people simply seeking safety that America is at war with them."},{"comment_id":"706998779490700","commenter_b":"I'll help her pack!!!

See what happened was the person who served the food dropped them exact three fries on the floor, that lady was actually being a good Samaritan and helping the cop and taking the dirty fries away for him so he did not get sick. Long story short don't do anything nice for cops because they are assholes and will do everything they can to abuse their power and fuck over the average civilian. I made all of this up of course but all of us know never even talk to a cop unless you absolutely have to because they are just looking for a opportunity to arrest anyone because they are bored. She should have just waited for her own fries. Stupid decisions get stupid results.","post_message":"A woman was arrested in Northwest D.C. for stealing three French fries from a police officer who was dining at a U Street eatery. #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"10153324817246523","commenter_b":"And this is only the beginning of another year in Wisconsin.","commenter_a":"Oh people quit ur whining an complaining!
