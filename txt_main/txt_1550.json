I can't see any difference between Christian or Islamic fundamentalism. Both are as dangerous and frightening. It's really sad, that people will believe more in something people has written ages ago, instead of in the scientific facts we have nowadays, and that they will judge people according to some moral standards from the Middle East (by the way the same moral standards as in Islam), instead of thinking for themselves. And before anyone says the Bible is God's word, show me ONE sentence that is written by God, or Jesus, or even anyone living at the same time as Jesus. There is no such sentence.","post_message":"George Takei says it right. Let's \"kick the ick\" out of our public discourse!"},{"comment_id":"446887825521787","commenter_b":"Brake down that Wall Pope.
