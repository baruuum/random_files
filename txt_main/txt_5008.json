Eight years as a team member under her husband Bill. point here is that Hillary Rodham Clinton has been doing this for a long time: seeing the world through a political lens and revealing an uncommon solidity of judgment and perspective. ... just because she has risen higher than any woman in American politics, but because she is by far the most experienced candidate of any of those running in either party this year.

Cabinet members are to be experts in their field, not solely a wealthy donor to republicans. This is not a try out situation. There is not a revote.
