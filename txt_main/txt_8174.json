So your way off on \"over 500 years\" more like 200 years. And the majority of this country was built by Irish and Chinese labor not black. How come for hundreds of years Irish were slaves, yet Irish people don't use it as a crutch and a complaint of why they can't do something. 6 million Jews killed in the holocaust, that was from 1933-1945 that was roughly 1350 a day for 12 years. Yet Jewish people don't use it as a crutch and a complaint why they can't do something. Neither one of these groups were given nearly as much entitlement as the black community.... Yet the black community still complains that it's not enough that they can't get ahead. And yes most people look at black on black crime and ...","commenter_a":"What pisses me off is people that deflect this issue with Black on Black violence. Like y'all don't know that we just got rights in this country 50 years ago and the subsequent aftermath of white supremacy for over 500 years is the reason we live in impoverished areas with the shittiest schools. Y'all DO know that those circumstances breed violence right? Don't act like White men have not committed the most violent atrocities in this country since it's inception. Don't act like your \"discovery\" of America wasn't simply genocide. Don't act like multiple billion dollar industries that people still reap the benefits of today and in the future weren't built on free labor that black people don't see a penny of. Read sometimes. You will know why the black community has violence. Still to this day the most heinous crimes and serial murders are committed by white men.

Thugs with guns and badges paid by our tax dollars.","commenter_a":"This is where we are today: Killer cops kill civilians and get away with it. Civilians kill cops and either get killed by other killer cops, or if very lucky, they get arrested, charged, and sentenced. Killer cops have no empathy for civilians they kill, or their families. The copsuckers show no empathy for the victims of killer cops who again, get away with it. If the killer cops, along with their apologists don't show empathy for the victims of police killings, why should civilians show empathy for the killed cops? If the killer cops won't shed tears when civilians get killed by cops, why should civilians shed tears when cops get killed? If the killer cops along with their apologists think it's OK for the civilians to be killed by cops (the unjustified killings), why shouldn't the civilians think it's OK for the cops to be killed?
