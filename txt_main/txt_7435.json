Theres just been several bills past so that its now need to know disclosed. And America has had the uk parliament put these same laws here. So that from a judge is a downright lie. Also almost every american these days became that way from imigrants. Infact at one point more than half of Scotlands population emigrated to the Usa. To try and scare monger over a handfull of idiots that went mental over the several million who are helping the united states in the military, your hospitals , your restaurants etc. Its just cringeworthy and shamefull.
