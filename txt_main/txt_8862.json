Scares the hell out of me..I have a 7 year old granddaughter and she can swim..but it only takes 2 seconds for a drunk to jump on her w/o supervision. .Thank god my daughter watchers her like a hawk! THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT $$$ ITS TIME FOR LIFEGUARDS AND WATCH YOUR CHILD AS WELL!!!! And all Disney hotels have LIFEGUARDS! I live near them and we take our granddaughter Isabella to one every year for her Birthday!","commenter_a":"It is really no different than at a hotel. You don't have lifeguards at a hotel pool. There are signs posted that no lifeguards are on duty and parents need to watch their kids.","post_message":"There are as many as 1,000 employees aboard large cruise ships, but three major cruise lines employ no lifeguards on their ships. Why not?"},{"comment_id":"10153022135468635","commenter_b":"The Jesus I know of hung around with prostitutes, drunks and gamblers. I imagine he certainly wouldn't have used social media to put down homosexuals because he would have been too busy loving them.","commenter_a":"The strong homosexual, transgender movement today is not surprising. It is a sign of how there will be a new world order. It is disturbing but it also points closer to our seeing Lord Jesus.","post_message":"\"Vines argues that while the Levitical code forbids homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22) it also forbids eating shellfish (Leviticus 11:9-12). Yet, he says, Christians no longer regard eating shellfish as wrong â€” so why can't we change our minds on homosexuality? Here Vines is rejecting the New Testament understanding that the ceremonial laws of Moses around the sacrificial system and ritual purity were fulfilled in Christ and no longer binding, but that the moral law of the Old Testament is still in force.\""},{"comment_id":"1485178544875222","commenter_b":"Of course we had an impact in the region through corruption but Saudi armed Sunni rebels in Syria to overthrow Assad which formed ISIS, the US is supporting groups against Assad so that Saudi can build a pipeline to Europe and destroy Russia's main source of income","commenter_a":"It does make sense though, when you think about it. Would you just accept thousands of people without carrying out appropriate checks (ie checking if they have criminal record, etc)? You wouldn't. Seeing what has happened in Europe in the last year or so is all the more reason for countries to tighten their borders. Also, people have been spreading this meme for ages so it's nothing new.","post_message":"So crass"}]
