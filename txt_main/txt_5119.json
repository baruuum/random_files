These people are not protesters, they are rioters, violent disrespectful, criminal thugs. The main stream , elite owned media is not reporting on this, you will not hear Hillary Clinton tell the Democrats or anyone outside of trump rallies to stop the violence, they support this, they support black lives matter. As long as they feel it is helpful to their side especially Hillary, (getting in the White house will keep her from going to jail), they will let it continue.

A little girl will look to her mother for what a woman is and how to act. When you are body obsessed, your daughter will pick up on it. If you're working out, eating decent, and taking care of yourself, she'll pick up on that also.","commenter_a":"The stretch marks are redic. She looks like a Plane Jane.

Men work more hours, more dangerous jobs. Statistics are a bitch. The pay gap is a myth. Plain, simple. Even a feminist can see it. But yall keep pretending. Keep that victim thing going.","commenter_a":"People. It takes literally five minutes or less to find a credible publication explaining exactly what the wage gap is, and it really isn't anything in fact. It's just kind of inherently flawed, it is NOT based on men / women doing the same work but rather every man's wage and every woman's wage for EVERY FULL TIME JOB PERIOD, from waitress to business executive. It doesn't mean men are paid more automatically for being men, it just means men are generally getting the higher paying jobs (which there are legitimate sociological reasons for), OR men are more willing to do dirty / dangerous jobs that women are generally unwilling to do. So assuming of ten... Oh I don't know, sewer workers making 20 dollars an hour , eight are men and two are women, and of ten store clerks making 13 dollars an hour , eight are women and ...","post_message":"Jon: You're telling me we're going to print a human heart out of a Xerox machine before women get pay equality?

All 3 of these women have helped over the years to set Americans back 30-40 years. They are simply useless Politicians!! I agree with @username, Diane Fierstein and everyone who voted in favor of her proposed bill should be thrown out of office for violating their Oath of Office. This Bill had it passed would have been in violation of the 2nd and 5th Ammendments, and to attempt to pass such a law is clearly a failure to \"protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Enough of this Liberal Politically Correct BS. Time for change and Hillary and Bernie clearly are not the answer.","commenter_a":"Time to vote the senile out of office or just plain remove them!! How do you prove innocence if you haven't done anything? So they could just accuse you of something and then make you prove you \"didn't\" do it?????? And in the meantime you couldn't get a gun!! Is she for real??","post_message":"You won't believe that Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein just said about due process.
