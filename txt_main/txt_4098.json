Be careful what you wish for you just might get it","commenter_a":"I had 3 sons and they all registered when they turned of age. I would have not wanted them to go but if I had a daughter which I don't I would not want her to be drafted and put in the position of getting captured. It is bad enough what they do to men when captured you can imagine what they would do to women before doing to them what they do to men. I do now have a grand daughter and a grandson. I hope neither of them ever have to go thru a war. I also hope everyone else's kids don't either.","post_message":"The Senate voted this week to require women to register for the draft.

Biggest moochers on the planet, biggest joke presidency. Not enough he more than doubled the national debt, now in his mere final weeks, they go ahead and keep living high on the hog. Trump was not my pick among GOP candidates, but doing this stuff for 8 years while telling successful hardworking citizens ,\"you didn't earn that\" or \"some folks are going to have to give up their piece of the pie\" really screamed to everyone on how we don't want this again.","post_message":"Aloha Obamas!"},{"comment_id":"993534210682000","commenter_b":"These illiterate students should be in class learning something !!!","commenter_a":"I agree with every post here! They should have forfeited the game and then raised the tuition to cover what loss incurred that reduces tuition. End of story.

They are a whole level of crazy I don't want to be around. Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other!

Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was \"stronger together, peace, love, equality\"......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters. Your example is clear.","post_message":"Protesters burned American flags and chanted \"not my president\" despite Democrats' calls for a peaceful transition of power."},{"comment_id":"803355223130806","commenter_b":"we love newt, let the whole world know about her shady crap , we don't care about your tax release, she has the nerve to talk crap about that and look at her hiding server deleated emails, noooooo way. go TRUMP","commenter_a":"Good Luck with Today President Trump!!Go Gently, but be Strong!!
