When was the last time she looked in a mirror ...","post_message":"Another thing noticed in the Wikileaks release of the full transcripts Hillary Clinton’s paid appearances for Goldman Sachs: she described Republicans as “backward-looking” and fundamentally un-American.”  So in addition to being rednecks (according to Bill), people who don’t support her politically are racists, sexists, homophobes, xenophobes and Islamophobes; a “basket of deplorables” who are backward, irredeemable and fundamentally un-American.    So I have to wonder: why does she want to be the leader of all us horrible people?  If she hates everyone who disagrees with her that much, instead of running for President, why doesn’t she just run for mayor of Berkeley?"},{"comment_id":"461391564049150","commenter_b":"Well Paid Bitch","commenter_a":"Not surprising, have you listened to her for more than a few minutes?

If schools provided such an education, the climate that allows racist language and behaviour would cease to exist. Promoting such an education should be a priority for government, however in Britain we have a school system that has little interest in education.\""},{"comment_id":"1385280774831907","commenter_b":"#NEVERTRUMP #NEVERHILLARY #NEVERBERNIE @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Have stop watch Faux News! #nevertrump","post_message":"\"In Hillary's America we focus on Hillary, but we also focus on the whole sordid history of the Democratic Party.
