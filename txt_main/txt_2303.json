Tried juicing for almost a year, cutting out eating \"real\" food almost all together... Ended up doing more damage to her gut than good. Bodies are made to eat food and not meant to get over loaded with vitamins and nuetrints from juicing 40 carrots. I think in small doses it can be beneficial but not as a replacement","post_message":"Even in Trump's America, juicing is still awful."},{"comment_id":"10153810084117169","commenter_b":"Cornelia Gnutow Thompson","commenter_a":"The truth has a way of asserting itself.

When Jeb Bush signed the law forbidding to give the Driver License to illegal people in 2005 (he was the first governor to do it), he wanted to push the deportation of millions of illegal NON Cubans from Florida, who could not continue driving and give their jobs to millions of Cubans rafters newcomers. Bush never thought in unemployed veterans or other US citizens. He only has Cubans in his agenda.","commenter_a":"He will lead this country to a war in the sand...and your children will be buried there.....","post_message":"How a group of hecklers forced Jeb Bush to go off script and talk about immigration."},{"comment_id":"10153395223571336","commenter_b":"Pull up your skirt and grow a pair .","commenter_a":"I'm not Mexican but his comments were offensive. There are many honorable Mexican Americans and his words disrespected all Latin Americans. I happen to be a conservative republican, and in favor of tightening up the border issue. Donald Trump is an emotional and impulsive idiot and we don't need that in the White House. We need someone that will unite us, not separate us.","post_message":"“I’m going to have to sue Univision now.”  Moments ago, Donald J.

But the personal attacks don't add anything to the argument. There's plenty of solid evidence to dispute among the things she says and has written. \"Old and sad,\" \"horse face\" and other things don't contribute to the discussion.
