You don't see that those women keep on having babies that they can't take care of and are sold into prostitution. Oh, but im wrong for believing in controlling the problem. And no bitch, I got my tubes cut and burned, because I dont believe in having more then what I can take care of.","commenter_a":"Since they don't have protection & clearly can't afford children why not find alternatives to intercourse? Or maybe idk use some self control & abstain from sex altogether? They are consenting adult women fully aware of the possible outcome/consequences of their choices.
