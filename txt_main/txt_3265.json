It left over 180,000 tailor and mobile homes in Louisiana that the people never used and this sh**hole of a government could have added to that number and moved them all over the Midwestern farms for many of this countries people living off long term benefits!

And since you have to take medicine for the rest of your life so your body won't reject your transplants use your pee brain which you obviously have and think about the medicine that's affecting your skin color and NOT the fact that an African American gave you his/her parts to keep your sorry butt alive.","post_message":"This man says that receiving a transplant from an African-American has turned his skin black.
