No the kids shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff but why would a grown woman behave that way over some toys and trash.","commenter_a":"This woman didn't handle this situation well at all.

One of the most disgusting men in in our country won the election. I am so sickened by the citizens who would cast their vote for such an evil man.

Perhaps to show he is working in good faith, don't you think he should have them manufactured here in the US? It is quite simple to say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that but it is far more difficult to actually do them. He might say it, if elected he might try and do it but I guarantee you he is not going to \"make\" the Mexicans pay for his wall, a wall that will actually do little to stop the flow of illegals. The gun he will hold to the Mexicans head to make ...","commenter_a":"Trump wants to build a wall on the border and make Mexico pay for it, deport illegals, cut taxes on the middle class and corporations, destroy Isis, take care of our veterans, strengthen our military, build the keystone pipeline, repeal Common Core, repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market based system, stop SS and welfare fraud, fight Mexico and China unfair trade and currency practices, preserve the sanctity of the unborn life, preserve the sanctity of the 2nd amendment ... that's conservatism ... that's patriotism ... that's what it will take to bring America back to greatness","post_message":"Take a look at the companies that are partnering with this pro-amnesty open-borders group!   @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153665284600163","commenter_b":"and what's wrong with PUSSY?
