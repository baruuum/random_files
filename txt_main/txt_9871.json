To bad his plans don't include everyone. Especially when it comes to healthcare. Did you know that if Obama care is rebuild and replaced if you have a pre-existing condition then you cannot get medical coverage just like before during the Bush administration","commenter_a":"Truth! Dirty Donnie is playing us like a fiddle! All about him so he can make $$$$! He is not FOR anything but himself! Do you really think he is for you blue collar workers or the struggling middle class? Once he gets what he wants, he'll throw you to the gutter like a piece of trash. He is all about the $$ going into his pocket. His \"plan\" would put the workers back into the industrial age. Company town and company store, no unions, no rights, keep your mouth shut and just maybe you won't get fired, thrown out of your home, and dumped on the street! Tax cuts for the rich and everyone else can pay for it. Build a personal defense for to consolidate his power, throw opponents in jail, purge the government of the opposition,and align himself with his buddy Putin!

The C Level staff walk away with millions and everyone else has to suck it up.","post_message":"What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he was going to stand up for working people it turns out that Wall Street and Goldman Sachs are still running the show - and the Trump administration. Among many other billionaires in the Trump administration is Gary D. Cohn, the departing president of Goldman Sachs and Trump's new director of the National Economic Council. Upon leaving Goldman Sachs, Cohn just received an exit package of $285 million. Yes, $285 million.  And that's how the rigged economy and oligarchy works. The middle class of this country bailed out Goldman Sachs to the tune of over $800 billion. Goldman Sachs paid a $5 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury for illegal activity, as did virtually every other major bank. Meanwhile, no top Wall Street executive is prosecuted for criminal activity. Instead, the president of Goldman Sachs becomes the leading financial adviser to the President. And, to add insult to injury, Cohn and the Trump administration will soon end up supporting huge tax breaks for the rich while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Can we stop them? Yes. But only through a powerful and focused grassroots movement which tells Congress to represent us all, not just the 1 percent."},{"comment_id":"10154294683907061","commenter_b":"Wow what a brilliant idea.
