But, The KKK in the early 20 th century, hijacked this Flag, (Symbol) and carried out Murder, Lynching and Devastation to many in the South, and all over America ! Unfortunately, but accurately, these two SYMBOLS represent, Horror & Evil beyond most comprehension. Many perceive the Swastika as Evil, (When related to The Nazi Party, they're correct) & Many perceive the Confederate Flag as Evil, (When related to Racism, they're correct). What you perceive is how you believe.... Perception is Reality.
