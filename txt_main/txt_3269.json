Nothing is impossible, if we want to do it. If we can dig tunnels below, we can build walls above.","commenter_a":"It doesn't sound like trump at all. That's most probably what trump should have said. Everything bill Clinton said has been implemented. He doesn't mention deporting 12 million people (impossible to execute), he doesn't mention building a wall (idiotic and impossible to execute)... So no, doesn't sound like trump at all. This sounds like someone that actually has a executable plan, unlike trump. Not to mention calling a whole nation rapists, murders and drug dealers.","post_message":"Do you think this sounds a lot like Donald J. Trump?

It is becoming more and more common in foreign countries to drug and even use ether to sedate people so they can rob them. I find the guy suspicious that said when he saw in the AM that their door was as he had left it he became worried. How did he leave it...closed like every other hotel room door? It's not like housekeeping found them. This guy called mgmt and they went in. Sounds suspicious","post_message":"The autopsy for the two American sisters found dead in their luxury hotel room determined there were \"no visible signs of injuries found on the bodies.\""}]
