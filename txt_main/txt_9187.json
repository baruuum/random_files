And she was married to a white brute. Her lies did not influence either Till's murder or the trial's outcome.","commenter_a":"People are quick to point out how different things were back then for blacks but don't forget how different they were for women, especially in the Deep South. What she did was horrendous, don't get me wrong, but I have no doubt that she feared for her own life. She was married to a man that could commit that kind of a crime. The article said that she was hidden away around the time of the trial with HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY. Don't you think she was threatened by them? I have no doubt of it. Being a women, even a white woman, was only marginally better than being black down there at that time. She will answer to God but, have no doubt, she has had to live with the knowledge of what she's done and had reminders along the way of what that entailed with reminders in her own ...","post_message":"60 years after this poor boy was brutally murdered, she finally admits the truth?"},{"comment_id":"675938265864099","commenter_b":"@username you wish your wife could be a go go dancer.","commenter_a":"Melania is an absolutely classic beauty.

HeII, they don't anyway! The last thing illegals are interested in is going into a Court of Law! These people will suffer in silence before testifying against one of their own. It's time for a change. In Europe, everybody has a PassPort or legit I.D. And cops and soldiers can stop you at any time. You produce that I.D. or you go to jail. Simple. Time for a national I.D. in the States!","post_message":"Democrat leader sides with illegal aliens over mom whose son was murdered by one."}]
