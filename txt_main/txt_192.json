The paperwork is difficult and the cost somewhat prohibitive.Add to that English is not their native language and it becomes nearly impossible. When a mexican national pays $2500-4000 to a coyote to bring him here because it's easier and cheaper, it screams how broken our system is and how strongly we ask those who truly want to come here and work, to do it illegally. We make it easier to break the law than to obey it. We, the American people are complicit in this crime at present. This activity encourages the welfare state, trains new citizens to act irresponsibly, and costs the working class American tens of thousands of dollars each for this miscarriage of justice.","commenter_a":"Wanna know how precious your American Citizenship is?

You do know that cows and fish are animals and killed in order to make the food you find at McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Arby's, Subway, Taco Bell, Panda Express, Red Robin, Dennys, IHOP, etc. right?","commenter_a":"Don't do it! They're a little too conservative for our area. Do people really want to support a company that not-so-secretly opposes equal rights (not to mention the whole killing of animals thing...)? @webpagelink","post_message":"The fast-food chain is looking to to add one or two restaurants a year until there are 10 to 12 locations in the greater Portland area."}]
