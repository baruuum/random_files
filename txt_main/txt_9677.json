Lol.","commenter_a":"The comments here have be idiotic, as I expected. Most likely, this was an attack due to their religious identification. I love how when the victim is not Muslim, these (commenters here) jump to radical Islam. However, when a Muslim is the victim, they want to wait for the facts and not jump the gun.

There are reasons they had to close up. Their computers weren't working and they were forced to close maybe for an hour. Stupid tourist wanted to fight. She assaulted the employee first (yes, throwing water at someone is considered assault) causing the employee to be in defensive mode. Maybe that employee should be suspended for 2 days and hopefully she's not fired.","commenter_a":"What? You are not going to stack the coupons and price match??","post_message":"A woman's desire for a post-Christmas bargain took a violent turn.
