Given the fight Fonda now has against North American oil discovery and transportation, she has once again aided and abetted the enemy: Islamic oil producers. It seems Jihadi Jane neither understands how her actions are viewed by the enemy (major Muslim oil exporters, some of whose core members want to see the destruction of the United States) nor how these anti-jobs protests impact hundreds of thousands of North American families. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153379305754205","commenter_b":"I was more surprised that Kenny Rogers was still alive, but at what cost?

The big news network had been obviously bias against one candidate and it seems that this candidate cannot do anything right for them for obvious reasons. Even the Roman Catholic hierarchy are all bent on preventing our presidential candidate to win the election. But lo and behold the people have spoken and are up in arms against these giant nerworks and rallied their candidate of choice to win decisively. Wake up America you are being manipulated by a few who have selfish interest and only have themselves to enjoy if their will be done.","post_message":"President George W.
