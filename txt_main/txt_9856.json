Perhaps the NFL should start requiring artists to submit song choices & performance videos ahead of time for approval or better yet just have a military or top-ranked college marching band perform.","commenter_a":"She's disgusting and an embarrassment to the entire country. The Superbowl was not the place for a political statement and someone at the NFL should be held responsible for her selection.
