The paperwork is difficult and the cost somewhat prohibitive.Add to that English is not their native language and it becomes nearly impossible. When a mexican national pays $2500-4000 to a coyote to bring him here because it's easier and cheaper, it screams how broken our system is and how strongly we ask those who truly want to come here and work, to do it illegally. We make it easier to break the law than to obey it. We, the American people are complicit in this crime at present. This activity encourages the welfare state, trains new citizens to act irresponsibly, and costs the working class American tens of thousands of dollars each for this miscarriage of justice.","commenter_a":"Wanna know how precious your American Citizenship is?

The immigration process can always be improved but, to give out amnesty to the illegals is like saying don't worry about the long waits in line; hundreds of dollars spent on forms; and the months it takes to swear in as a US citizen. If illegal immigrants want amnesty then pick a number; pay a penalty, and follow the process including all the fees. People who are following the rules are deeply wronged by illegals jumping the line by receiving amnesty.","commenter_a":"God Bless Donald Trump as he is our next real President.","post_message":"Press Conference LIVE"},{"comment_id":"10153000077314197","commenter_b":"I prefer the old style plates.
