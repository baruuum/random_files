How about criticizing him where it's actually warranted instead of focusing on this nonsense?","post_message":"Bernie Sanders claims to be the champion of low-wage workers across America. However, what he did to a waiter recently proves that the rumpled, curmudgeonly socialist is full of hot air.  None of the GOP field would have EVER done this... not even Christie.

The media would have been outraged about these alligators lives being snuffed out because of these negligent parents! If is says restricted or no swimming, then they should have checked with the lifeguard before putting their child in harms way!!! Not fair to those alligators and MOST DEFINITELY a tragedy for that child. There are terrible parenting skills on both sides. Black and white. Animal rights should have been on this just like Harambe. But then again, it was never about the animal. These parents should have been charged with the endangerment of their baby. Period.","post_message":"A total of six alligators were removed."}]
