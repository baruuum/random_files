Breaking up families is not a solution to this problem. These raids will just cause more pain and foster bad feelings. If they're here, let them stay, get them legalized so they help support the system they're using. Then lock it down and form a clear, sensible, reasonable, doable path to citizenship. we don't need a wall. We need penalties on companies that hire illegals, and serious reform on the \"war on drugs\" that incubates environments that force people to flee their homes. We have to stop blaming people who are looking for a better life, and start finding ways to help our neighbors reach the same level of community peace that we enjoy.","commenter_a":"I know this is going to be unpopular, but I know many Hispanics who agree with me. There is a legal way to come to the country, and contrary to some of the attacks I have seen on other posts, it does affect our low income Black, Hispanic, and White communities. They are used to a more extreme poverty, so they are willing to work for less than minimum wage, and are off the books, so taxes, SS are not paid. This means an American citizen or legal immigrant is denied a job. When so many of our jobs are being sent to Mexico, China, India how can we not address the issue of those who came here illegally.

Sending women and children back into harm's way after they already fled horrendous violence in Central America is painful and inhumane, and must be stopped.  Sign my petition asking President Obama to stop these raids and to make sure that families fleeing violence in Central America are protected from deportation."},{"comment_id":"581929555264971","commenter_b":"They need to be sent back to their own country, period! !","commenter_a":"I am getting to the point I really do dislike the new media, they are a bunch of useless asses","post_message":"The city of Twin Falls first made headlines when Muslim migrants sexually assaulted a five-year-old.
