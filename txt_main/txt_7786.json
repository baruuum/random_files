Even the absolute worst cop could be clubbing a baby and still, if he were shot and killed in the act he'd die a hero and we'd never hear the end of it.

But I work at a restaurant down the street from the county sheriff's department, and the boys in blue that come in are often disrespectful and rude, and act entitled to walk all over us because they're cops. They once refused to leave after we closed, even though they were done eating. I'll start respecting the blue more when the good ones start publicly, and loudly denouncing the ones who aren't.","post_message":"This officer had just finished a nice meal and was preparing to pay his bill when he noticed something written on the receipt."},{"comment_id":"572505492946269","commenter_b":"If we could just get a forty hour work week and more than minimum wage so we dont have to work 2 or 3 jobs, life would be a little easier.

Without her the path to a 2020 boderless world is stopped dead in it's place. Why oh Why do you think both the Republican and Democratic Party and all the World Cartel Leaders have done everything they can to get rid of Trump for a year? Jeb Bush, the heir apparent is a globalist and so is Hillary. So were the past 5 presidents. With both Jeb and Hillary running, it did not matter who won, the road to globalization was on tract. Enter Trump! Boy did he screw up their plans! No matter what they tried he did not go away! No globalization of America for him! Now as their last hoorah, most all of the newspapers have come out for Hillary and are printing every lie they can about Trump. It is only going to get worse the closer ...","post_message":"This is crucial progress in the push for better workplace policies."}]
