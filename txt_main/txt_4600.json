They were picked in 2015 and 2016… by the Obama administration. Trump doesn’t even list those nations specifically in his executive order, he simply lists that he’s banning those nations named in the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. ---> @webpagelink Trump’s TEMPORARY order specifically states that only refugees from 7 countries with ISIS controlled regions. (Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) ONLY AFFECT 12% OF THE WORLD’S MUSLIM POPULATION","commenter_a":"President Obama issued an order similar to President Trump’s in 2011 in response to a discovery that a known terrorist had entered the United States via the nation’s refugee program. It seems that much of the country’s forgotten about that, though even President Obama, himself, apparently.","post_message":"Obama's statement said he is \"heartened\" by citizens' civic engagement, but reiterated that policies should not discriminate against people based on religion."},{"comment_id":"10155862004711038","commenter_b":"That is impossible.
