Nothing is impossible, if we want to do it. If we can dig tunnels below, we can build walls above.","commenter_a":"It doesn't sound like trump at all. That's most probably what trump should have said. Everything bill Clinton said has been implemented. He doesn't mention deporting 12 million people (impossible to execute), he doesn't mention building a wall (idiotic and impossible to execute)... So no, doesn't sound like trump at all. This sounds like someone that actually has a executable plan, unlike trump. Not to mention calling a whole nation rapists, murders and drug dealers.","post_message":"Do you think this sounds a lot like Donald J. Trump?

But the government keeps bringing in illegals and sending our jobs to other countries and we cannot get away from living paycheck to paycheck. It is disguting that the most advanced country makes it citizens live like this. We know it is to control the population.","commenter_a":"Well Hillary is done if she does not win. Without her the path to a 2020 boderless world is stopped dead in it's place. Why oh Why do you think both the Republican and Democratic Party and all the World Cartel Leaders have done everything they can to get rid of Trump for a year? Jeb Bush, the heir apparent is a globalist and so is Hillary. So were the past 5 presidents. With both Jeb and Hillary running, it did not matter who won, the road to globalization was on tract. Enter Trump! Boy did he screw up their plans! No matter what they tried he did not go away! No globalization of America for him!
