It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the President to keep the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton State Department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise. The need for a Special Prosecutor to investigate these apparent crimes mounts with every passing day and the revelation of new sets of e-mails and phone logs. I‚Äôm sure all we‚Äôve seen is the tip of the iceberg and there will be more to follow.‚Äù -Rudy Giuliani"},{"comment_id":"10154592299555579","commenter_b":"this woman is about one thing only‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶money and power and fame‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.she has sold her soul‚Ä¶...","commenter_a":"WATCH CSPAN!!","post_message":"Laura Ingraham says to \"all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump now.
