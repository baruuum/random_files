She is a murderous also. Her stint as Secretary of State and her private e-mail server has put us in great danger from our enemies. If you plan to vote for Hillary raise your right hand and slap yourself in the face!","commenter_a":"I really like you Dr Carson but if this is true why do you support TRUMP, who lies, has no common sense and won't release his tax returns.

She refused. An officer was called since a teacher cannot physically remove a student from a classroom. The officer asked her to come with him, she refused and pushed him. She had then assaulted a police officer. Which is an arrest-able offense. She then resists arrest while further assaulting the officer (hitting him). Why does anyone think this is ok? These children have no respect for authority. I see most people defending her. Seriously?","post_message":"This guy can bench press 605 pounds, and he threw that tiny girl across the room. And the one they arrest is the girl who was brave enough to stand up to him."},{"comment_id":"10153522197479255","commenter_b":"Fuck you, lady.","commenter_a":"This people have been drinking the Kool-Aid!!!","post_message":"Obama is officially the best president the U.S. has had in a long, looong time.

Nice job. I see you really are the pro life party.","commenter_a":"How can it be that after viewing the videos and seeing the sonograms that people can STILL only talk about the \"rights of the woman\"? How can that be? And the sad thing is the terrible damage abortion does to women and many men.","post_message":"BREAKING: The House has passed #HR3134, my bill to freeze all federal funding to Planned Parenthood.
