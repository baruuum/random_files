At age 72 I am with Stevie. I think we worked too hard to go backwards. I remember when I was first married there were states where it was against the law for a woman to use any form of birth control other than abstinence.

They treated him like that bc they believe him to be a wolf in Sheep's clothing. I find him very entertaining but he is the Clintons wild card. He will divide the republicans so democrats will win.
