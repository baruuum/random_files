Even Muslims know Islam is not a religion but an ideology of submission only. Therefore you owe Ben Carson an apology for being correct when he said they are not covered under OUR constitution. READ the Quran for yourself Carly and you will find out that you are an Infidel and are to be killed if you do not SUBMIT to Allah. Does that sound like someone our constitution would support? I think NOT!","post_message":"Carly Fiorina just revealed what she thinks about Ben Carson's comments about a Muslim serving as President of the United States - and you might be surprised with where she stands...

Wish I was a Floridian.","commenter_a":"Since we have Debbie Wasserman Schultz to hold to the fire for unfairly slanting the elections, I thought it might be productive to take her to task and donate to her democratic rival in Florida's 23 district Tim Canova. Knock her right the hell out of her seat in congress. Might wanna throw him 5 bucks and help him send her packing.
