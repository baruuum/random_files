Guns don't kill people, but people with guns can and do kill more people than those without. Who would have been at fault if the kids shot out the car window and killed someone? The kid, or her for failing to secure a murderous weapon? What if after after being almost killed by her son, she veered into on-coming traffic and kills another driver? Who is at fault then? Not only do I not understand the pro-gun and pro-kill people, I don't believe their justification for wanting to kill.","commenter_a":"Dumb ass","post_message":"The mom, a pro-gun activist who runs the page Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense, told deputies her 4-year-old son shot her in the back with a .45-caliber handgun that was on the floor of her pickup truck."},{"comment_id":"1198337853547380","commenter_b":"Simple solution, ARREST Them and prosecute to the full extent of the law!

It was a Pre Egyptian and Egyptian emblem...It can also be found in Native American symbols. But Hitler and Nazi horror's exploited The Symbol ! The Confederate Flag, has much History and status. But, The KKK in the early 20 th century, hijacked this Flag, (Symbol) and carried out Murder, Lynching and Devastation to many in the South, and all over America ! Unfortunately, but accurately, these two SYMBOLS represent, Horror & Evil beyond most comprehension. Many perceive the Swastika as Evil, (When related to The Nazi Party, they're correct) & Many perceive the Confederate Flag as Evil, (When related to Racism, they're correct). What you perceive is how you believe.... Perception is Reality. Removal is just...Now what will Mississippi do ?","post_message":"They really destroy the argument for keeping the racist flag around."}]
