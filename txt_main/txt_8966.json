I'm tired of all of the meth head thieves , I can't even imagine how many children across America are going through the same life endangering situations becouse of the parents being hooked on meth .. don't spend the tax payers money on jail , send them to treatment for several months . I'm sure these parents were decent human beings before meth took over . Unfortunately now they have like all meth heads done sinister,and incomprehensible acts .

Maybe not the barrel roll but everything else is explained. The reason why he told those kids to get down was because they ran and were evading the police. I didn't see how that went down but he at least it to them and did not physically harm those kids.
