That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today.

Uplifting, heartfelt, inspiring... Courage, intelligence, compassion, awareness, education... Caitlyn pointed out many of the crucial life and death issues facing trans folks nationally and globally. She made an impassioned plea for acceptance and respect for all of humanity and the trans community in particular. For such a new figure in the global trans community, she did an excellent job at getting the truth across. Her speech had me in tears early on and particularly when she addressed her family and her mom. Something additional: twenty percent of transgender people have served in the military, which is double the percentage of the U.S. general population that has served. Close to 16,000 trans folks are currently serving in the U.S. military. Close to 135,000 trans Veterans have served.","post_message":"\"Oh you know, just in the kitchen by myself crying because of Caitlyn Jenner's ESPYs speech.\""},{"comment_id":"1102153109844436","commenter_b":"Women need sex","commenter_a":"She should be locked up!
