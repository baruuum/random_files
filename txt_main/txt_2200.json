EVERY single one of the stories includes silencing of one kind or another-- often violent, often sexual violence. But it is a political poem by an exiled poet who was being silenced. HE tells a story about a bad (silencing) king and then says something directly to the emperor-- \" And you oh Augustus...\" Zeus was a rapist but he does not get praise for his philandering; his wife punishes the victim (the mother of nearly every demigod) since her husband is in power, but some god or goddess usually intervenes. Those rapes or dalliances are metaphorical for deeper political angst in Rome.","post_message":"Some professors believe trigger warnings build trust.

The parent who allows their child to disturb all the people around them trying to enjoy a meal is inconsiderate and selfish! The excuse that the child is waiting too long for food is poor at best. You as a parent and should come prepared to entertain your child... That includes providing them snacks and toys. The parents should have removed that child from the table within 5 minutes of the unresolved tantrum. Yes... I am a parent and never allowed that to happen. Remember that you are not the only person in that establishment spending hard earned money to enjoy a simple meal!","post_message":"DINER OWNER YELLS AT CRYING CHILD: \"I turned around, slammed both hands on the counter and then pointed at the child and said, 'This has got to stop!'\" said Darla Neugebauer, after she says a toddler cried for more than 40 minutes.
