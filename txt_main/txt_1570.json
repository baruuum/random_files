Evolutionary dating methods are not infallible science, are based on certain built-in assumptions, and have been proven to be contradictory and inconsistent. Please read my popular Internet article, ARE FOSSILS REALLY MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD? There a lot of evidence that the fossil layers were not deposited by gradual floods, which would have required millions of years. Rather, the evidence strongly points to a one world-wide flood that fossilized species, just as the Bible teaches. The fossil layers in the real world are not even found in the sequence taught in evolutionary textbooks. There are many places where fossils of complex creatures are found beneath simpler ones, and there are fossils of mixed species existing in the same stratum which classic evolutionary textbooks teach should have been separated by millions of years. There is absolutely no proof of macro-evolution in the fossil record. ...","post_message":"BREAKING"},{"comment_id":"10153181017133690","commenter_b":"Okay white terrorist","commenter_a":"Christian Terrorist","post_message":"\"This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime,\" Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of the two slain women, said. \"This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt.

Ban all guns in the U.S. it will make us safer but keep the borders open so when the black market opens the guns can flow in like water. On an ending note; Police are in no way obligated to protect you from any threat per the Supreme Court so I guess when they do show up they can draw that chalk outline around your fresh corpse.","commenter_a":"Blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit out of all the diehard ammosexual blowhards who love their guns. Europe doesn't have the problems we have in the country with guns. Neither does Canada or Australia. You want to believe what you want to believe. Follow the money. It's the NRA who wants you to keep your guns and fills your head with nonsense that you're just too willing to believe because you have no balls and tiny dicks. Try thinking about things instead of just buying into the rhetoric. The USA is safer now than at any other time in history. Why do you need them? Why focus on fairy tales like imagined revolutions against the government instead of focusing on things that are ACTUALLY happening like kids being killed in schools by LEGALLY OWNED GUNS.","post_message":"A company that worked on ‘Taken 3’ with Liam Neeson didn’t take kindly to his comments about the U.S."},{"comment_id":"10152526323082377","commenter_b":"Go away","commenter_a":"a gubbament BIG ENOUGH to GIVE you everything you WANT, is also BIG enough to TAKE EVERYTHING you have!! see what happens when you DONT VOTE!","post_message":"Oh Really..."},{"comment_id":"10154514668258701","commenter_b":"So, she thinks it's ok for POC to be racist.
