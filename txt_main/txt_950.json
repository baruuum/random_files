More level headed than many on social media. Personally I think Islam and Christianity are both a blight to our species- but it is your RIGHT to believe whatever you want. I'll gladly defend your right to be or believe whatever you want. I know Islam and Christendom view me as an abomination because I am gay- I think that is incredibly stupid but I still respect their right to believe it. There is no reason a female officer could not have dealt with this lady and, after checking for contraband, allowed her to keep it on.","commenter_a":"I'm so tired of seeing this article. I wear a hijab and I've been wearing it for 10 years and it's just as much my identity. But if I'm asked to take it off, I will. There's plenty of times I've been asked to remove it for security reasons and I comply, and that's not even because I got arrested. I'm pretty sure God isn't going to smite me for showing my hair to comply with the laws of the country I was born in and choose to reside in, which ironically gives me more religious freedom than living in a Muslim country. Is it entirely fair that this happened, probably not. A female officer could have taken her picture. But that didn't happen, and unfortunately being asked to remove your headscarf in a non-Islamic county doesn't amount to a violation of rights in the same way as it would ...","post_message":"“I’ve worn my scarf for 12 years and my religion says that I can’t take it off.
