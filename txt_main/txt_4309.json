So I think there is nothing to celebrate in this 40 year decline since then.","commenter_a":"I am surprised the director of this movie which claims it is historical, heard recording of 1964 meeting between LBJ and MLK and knew Johnson cared deeply over black voting issue but she depicted him as indifferent!

Our government is carrying political correctness to the point of suicide, just like all the European nations did by taking in millions of so-called refugees... People think it might be dangerous if Trump has his hands on the nuclear arsenal... how is that any worse than giving nukes to our biggest enemy who daily threaten our extinction and Israel's extinction???
