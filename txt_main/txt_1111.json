Unfortunately, that's nothing new and despite all the changes in the way our society views and treats women today, they are still objectified. Some women today even objectify themselves- Beyonce, the Kardashians, many others who make themselves sex objects in order to \"succeed\". As a female, you can't be an actress, a musical artist, a broadcaster on CNN or any other job in the public eye unless you're young and attractive. So if you're shocked or offended at Trump's words, you've been living under a rock. There are tens of thousands of men who think and talk like him and they're your fathers, brothers, husbands, co-workers, bosses, judges, CEOs, doctors, lawyers, cops and US Presidents. It's nothing new and it will never change.","commenter_a":"Sad for her. He is such a shameful person.","post_message":"JUST IN: Melania Trump issues statement following release of husband Donald J.
