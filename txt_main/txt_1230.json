Look at how God backed the Christians when they slaughtered 100 million native Indians because they foolishly loved their land and their own spirits, not accepting Christ as the son of God..... so, they were slaughtered... but, they told the men not to waste the ammunition on the women and kids, so they slashed them to death with sabers and machetes.... and God smiled at them...... And, since WW II the Christian Americans have invaded 37 countries killing between 20 and 30 million people, none of them were white Christians though, so God again smiled and nodded with His approval...... We spent $3 trillion on killing 500,000 innocent Iraqi citizens.... or $6 million per person killed..... it is really getting expensive to kill people nowadays isn't it..... Just think if we had spent that $3 trillion on food, we would have ...","commenter_a":"The Hillary and government set up is trying to keep the polls low for trump an high for hilkery, with the media and asking him politely bow out when Hillary wins it's all to hide the fact that they are cheating and they expect to win by their cheating so it will look good when they say she has won and Obama said he would not leave the White House and would blockade anyone coming in but they are trying to make Trump say that he won't fight.
