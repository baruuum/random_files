Where I grew up the \"N\" word was used frequently. Every time I was called that I retaliated. Im not a thug or a criminal. The teacher has to respect the students and vice versa. In hindsight the student should have went to the principal and then to his parents. Im in no way condoning what the student did but its a 2 way street. Dont bash the student when we dont know exactly what rhe teacher said. Racial slurs or any other forms of racism has no place in society. My kids or the kids I coach cant even say anything like that. Either way whatever was said isn't the problem. It was the lack of respect from the teacher and STUDENT.","commenter_a":"@username you say teachers need to watch what they say. I don't get it. What about the child. Dosen't he need to be taught. I don't like what you said so I punch you. There are other ways of handling verbal abuse. This is disgraceful.","post_message":"Witnesses say a Prince George's County Schools student punched his teacher over a racially insensitive comment: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154038979953279","commenter_b":"Very simple by democratically changing the Congress /Senate, and local states governments with stateswomen /men that supports Bernie's and we the people's agenda. If you think outside the subjugated status quo box where you live it is possible to allocate the economic resources where we want it to be instead of for example spending trillions on wars and then passing a debt bill to we the people so we paid more to wall street. Simple enough. We can even pass legislation specifying since that Iraq war was illegal due to lies for greed we can write off that illegal debt and don't paid to wall street. Hmm just brain storming the possibilities once we change the Congress, Senate, and Bernie is our POTUS. Just follow THE PANAMA PAPERS.","commenter_a":"Hillary is Cynical.
