Please.","commenter_a":"I hope you all understand that because the prosecutor went for a murder charge, this officer will be found not guilty. One, due to the fact that the prosecution will have to prove that an on duty officer was out there to kill someone, which won't happen. Two, for the fact that a vehicle is a deadly weapon and shooting a suspect using a vehicle in a manner that puts an officers life in danger is standard procedure and is taught in every academy in the U.S. This was a good shoot and the officer will be exonerated. But get ready to torch your local cvs for justice.","post_message":" is without question a murder, the prosecutor said about Sam Dubose's death.  didn do anything violent toward the officer.
