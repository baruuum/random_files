There is no proof that he called this lady Miss a Piggy and Miss Housekeeping. The video showed him defending her and complimenting her. I don't believe her story. She just wanted her 15 minutes of fame and the Clinton campaign probably paid her. I want a President who stands up for himself when attacked. I certainly defend myself when someone lies about me!! We need a strong leader!!!","post_message":"Leading conservatives are engaging in wishful thinking."},{"comment_id":"10155164817270093","commenter_b":"Hilarious.

Are there a few bad ones? Of course! The media really hypes the bad police officers, the knuckle heads looting and destroying communities \"in protest\". Not highlight the wonderful police officers laying their life on the line to protect our butts. Not highlighting the people that truly feel stepped on and are peacefully coming together with all to promote positive changes. \"Be the change that you wish to see in this this world.\" This is what I live by and teach my children. We should be brought together by love, not torn apart by hate.","post_message":"#EntertainmentNews  And the #BoycottBeyonce battle continues...the singer is being accused of using her recent Super Bowl performance \"to divide Americans by promoting the Black Panthers and her antipolice message.\"  Do you agree?"},{"comment_id":"1256135284407480","commenter_b":"Er, spider silk has almost nothing to do with a spider's reproductive system, other than if some species use it for mating rituals. So I don't think you can rape a spider. If they were to take off the harmless pins, it would find a corner and immediately start building a web, because it's a spider and it has no conscience. The closest I can relate to this spider is giving blood.","commenter_a":"Wow. That's horrific and pretty fucked up","post_message":"Poor spider!"}]
