Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we elected President Donald J. Trump. Help us reach more people by following our great pro-America page \"@username\", the only true patriotic cartoon comic strip. And let's Make America Great Again!
