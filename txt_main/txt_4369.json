Here Vines is rejecting the New Testament understanding that the ceremonial laws of Moses around the sacrificial system and ritual purity were fulfilled in Christ and no longer binding, but that the moral law of the Old Testament is still in force.\""},{"comment_id":"772068809592966","commenter_b":"the woman is not nearly as smart as a bucket of horse manure but is as pretty as one.","commenter_a":"Cher is still alive? ??","post_message":"As always.....leave it to Cruz to craft the most perfect response. ;)"},{"comment_id":"1730793227218701","commenter_b":"My dad years worked in the fields of Arizona I whent with him knights we would spent checking the water pipes it's hard work but he was a proud man I learned a lot from him the truth is they won't last a night it day in the fields they beg that's all they do lazy","commenter_a":"Yeah right !","post_message":"They wouldn't last a day!
