They just took a mother from he children who were born in this country!! We are the one's who are threatening the lives of people who trusted us and came here to make their lives better, just like Trumps mother did.

White people can get up out of bed, run a comb/brush through their hair and be out the door in five minutes. Blacks cannot do that so much, unless their hair is cut to their head--shaved. The rules negatively impact Blacks because without those styles, there isn't much left without using relaxers or paying for extensions. When rules or laws are placed for everyone as is here, but negatively impact one racial, religious, gender group, then it's discrimination and needs to be stopped.","commenter_a":"Can I ask an honest question? In that school, is there a ban on long slick hair, mullets or any other \"white hairstyles\". If so then I can actually understand the ban. But if there is no ban on \"white hairstyles\" like long slick hair, but there is a ban on \"black hairstyles,\" then yeah, i agree, it is discriminatory.","post_message":"This school just banned traditionally black hairstyles  and people are outraged.  #MicBrights"}]
