Think about that for a minute...yep every time you see her, hear her she will be lying, and you become one too...a horrible person! She let 4 beautiful men get tortured, sodomized, and killed, all because she didnt answer her phone. She deleted 33,000 classified emails after she got a supena. She will Open borders for hell to get in. ISIS will kill and you will be guilty of this. You will be guilty by association and all your friends will turn on you! All because you wanted the first woman President...We pitty you if she gets in....you won't get help from us....we will be to busy fighting for our guns to save America from her!...We choose TRUMP, a MOVEMENT beyond your reach.","commenter_a":"r I have watched Megan Kelly for a while now and use to love her show. However, I am so disappointed in her need to make a name for herself that she has sold herself to the devil and we all know who that is. Seriously, the sexual predator comment??? And you call yourself a lawyer, what happened to innocent until proven guilty or does that just apply to the Clintons! Why don't you call out Killary for disgracing the office of Secretary of State or even better her husband who has actually paid money to women for his sexual indiscretions. Oh, and how many people close to them are in the grave?? So @username...get rid of the trash and get some class....Hint\"...The Ainsley Earhardt File!!!!","post_message":"\"That's not law enforcement.

Fun to watch these morons head explode!!","commenter_a":"Although I'd love to see a woman president, the very last thing we need is a career criminal like Hillary Clinton (who's currently in violation of Article VI of the Constitution) . She's proven herself time and again to be both incompetent and dishonest. She has no new ideas, and will continue to push Obama's tired old routine of increasing taxes, not for the domestic good, but so that we can send billions to Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt and Israel. I would like a President who puts America first, for a change. The only candidate I've seen who shares these sentiments is Rand Paul, and he deserves my vote. By the way, many people are unaware that Obama's Democratic administration added $1.3 trillion in new taxes to small businesses, which lowers both wages and job creation. If you love America, vote Republican.","post_message":"Opinion: When Ayatollah Khamenei speaks, it pays to listen."},{"comment_id":"1757425844524023","commenter_b":"Is not as easy as you put it my friend, illegal immigrats don't just \"apply\" to get their papers...if it were that easy we woudnt have so many illegal immigrants.","commenter_a":"I am sure this girl is worried about deportation of her parent's. I am also certain that many kids of illegal immigrants living in the US are fearful.. but wouldn't parents apply for a visa and for proper citizenship? So their kids wouldn't live in fear?
