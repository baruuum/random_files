His ads are nothing but LIES and the only thing he does with any certainty is to lie about others and make the dishonest ads on TV trying to start a smear campaign. He's an underhanded ,sneaky and despicable person.","post_message":"RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:   Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.   Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.   Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.   Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it’s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.   Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.   Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.   In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.   One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don’t they are in default of their pledge to me.   I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again."},{"comment_id":"1729203870680375","commenter_b":"@username Hillary still lies but that's true of most people who are liars. Dr. Carson must be desperate to dredge up a case this old.","commenter_a":"It's too bad these supporters, like Dr. Carson here, doesn't go after the things that Trump says and does everyday instead of something Hillary did 35 years ago. I'll bet a lot of us could dig into our pasts and find things we could have done or said better but yet we're going to vote for Trump, who is supposed to have maturity and says the most mean spirited things any Presidential nominee has ever said and he says these horrible things practically every day.","post_message":"Another woman from Clinton's past is speaking out."},{"comment_id":"1047390088634796","commenter_b":"Jane I think you should try instead of History books the actual bill that was introduced in the Congress in 1983, the sponsors of the Bill, the Democratic almost unanimous vote, and the Democratic rationale behind their support.

After President Carter destroyed our country we needed to reform the Social Security System so it would be solvent as is the case today with Obama doubling down on the atrocities created by Carter. When Reagan took office he acknowledged that the system was broken and pledged to fix it. At the time we had a Republican President, a Democratic Congress and a Republican Senate but we also had a different set of principles in our politicians as they were devoid of loons like yourselves and the likes of Cruz. The Democratic house took care of all federal employees, all Federal Judges, all State Workers, all women's rights, raised the AGE of retirees from 65 to 67, took care of themselves, their staff and whoever else they could ...","post_message":"Jeb Bush has a plan to save Social Security: Ensure hardly anyone can qualify for it.
