If the President or Hillary would from the beginning, just tell the People the truth, that they screwed up. Most Americans will probably forgive, (But not forget) But Now we have to spend time and millions of dollars to do an investigation Same goes for President Clinton, just admit you got a blow job in the oval office and the American people would of probably forgave you. Nixon same thing, why can't they just do the right thing and tell the truth from the beginning. Friggin Politicians, I'm so sick of being lied to.","commenter_a":"I used to have hope that you were going to get the job done, @username but after all this time, I have lost faith in you and your committee. I think you are now part of the cover-up and just playing along to make it look like something is being done.","post_message":"It is deplorable that it took over a year for these records to be produced to our committee, and that our Democrat colleagues never lifted a finger to help us get them. Shame on them and everyone else who has demanded this committee to give up before gathering all of the facts. This investigation is about a terrorist attack that killed four Americans, and it could have been completed a lot sooner if the administration had not delayed and delayed and delayed at every turn. For example, the #Benghazi committee still does not have records we requested over a year ago, and we are still waiting for some witnesses to be made available for interviews. As soon as possible, we will release our report and interview transcripts so everyone can see the evidence for themselves, and Iâ€™m confident the value and fairness of our investigation will then be abundantly clear to everyone."},{"comment_id":"10153050473569255","commenter_b":",,,a bit back he was sucking kochs and the bitch owes!","commenter_a":"And how much does Cruz personally have invested in Keystone?","post_message":"I do enjoy Senator Ted Cruz's consistency in fouling up his own party's messaging."},{"comment_id":"10153508480963984","commenter_b":"She is a disgrace","commenter_a":"There is nothing here for a reality show.
