Trump] is far better to be commander-in-chief than Hillary Clinton in my mind. I don't think Hillary Clinton is going to do any of the things we need to do to get this country back on the right track.

Several people received transplants from my daughter and nothing happened to their skin. We are all the same inside and the only difference outside is that African American people have MORE pigment genes than white people. You did get their genes transplanted into you you got their organs which are exactly like yours that obviously failed. So what difference does it make where they came from. BE GRATEFUL YOU ARE ALIVE. And since you have to take medicine for the rest of your life so your body won't reject your transplants use your pee brain which you obviously have and think about the medicine that's affecting your skin color and NOT the fact that an African American gave you his/her parts to keep your sorry butt alive.","post_message":"This man says that receiving a transplant from an African-American has turned his skin black.
