And all you said are lies. Get your facts right! Compare the economy of the country before Obama era and Obama's era.

When will you stop infringing on legal gun owners and take the guns away from criminals? When will you outlaw gun free zones, which are obviously attracting all these liberal lunatics wh commit these horrendous acts against innocent people?
