The youth in your country and their parents . The main fact that ignorant Americans either fail to realize or completely ignore is that America is the #1 drug consumer country in the world ! In order to be a business there needs to be a demand. Your society is demanding drugs you people are raised on terrible values and customs which is why you are heavily consuming drugs ! If your government could find a way to avoid that demand and necessity the business would cease to exist. Your people are indirectly the cause of the blood that sheds south of the border . Of course you didn't do your research properly! BITCH.","commenter_a":"#BringBackJonStewart ... Sorry, but you're misinformed and simply not funny Trevor.
