Keep religion but don't ask for tax's breaks, don't try to teach kids pseudo science and don't knock on my door asking me to believe.

This is not a perfect union, yet but well keep pushing forward while you try to stop rational thinking.","commenter_a":"Turning people against their own beliefs in an attempt to get them to believe yours.
