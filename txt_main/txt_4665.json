They tend to dress sloppy, they don't bath, and when they think they're sexy they tend to show us way more than we want to see. So it works both ways.","post_message":"It isn't the clothes they have an issue with."},{"comment_id":"10153797602872060","commenter_b":"Bless you Chase!","commenter_a":"Thanks Chase!","post_message":"Chase Landry of The History Channel's \"Swamp People\" hitched his 20-foot aluminum flat-bottom boat and has rescued more people than he can count."}]
