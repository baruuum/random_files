Maybe a younger person follows what is 'the done thing' but with age and life experience, I think women just do what they want!","commenter_a":"It's just like the shaved pubes issue - all the same arguments. 'I do it for myself' etc etc. Look, virtually no young women shaved their pubes before porn videos made men expect it. And virtually no older women dyed their hair before looking our age became unacceptable. I've had enough of all this 'I do it for me' nonsense - look a bit deeper for god's sake and let's be a bit more honest about our motives and the forces that drive us.","post_message":"“We’ve been groomed – by the media, by advertisers, and now by ourselves – to understand that our gender has to try harder, to consume more, when it comes to our appearance.

I’m proud that our nation acted during that crisis to take in refugees, but I remain motivated by the knowledge that we could have done much, much more. The Statue of Liberty isn’t engraved with do not enter signs, it is proudly emblazoned with ‘give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.’ This is a quintessential American value and though we’ve not always lived up to our ideals, the President would do well to remember that we cannot afford to turn our backs on them, especially today—Holocaust Remembrance Day.   We are a nation that leads with strength—a nation that knows ‘the only thing we have to fear is fear itself’—not a nation that cowers in fear when faced with difficult choices. The America that I know is not one that slams its doors on families and children fleeing barbarism and terror, but one that shines brightly as a beacon of hope for all human beings. Giving in to our fears, as the President has done, is not the action of a strong country. Today’s order will ultimately serve to weaken our own national security, playing into our enemy’s hands and helping convince another generation of young people simply seeking safety that America is at war with them."},{"comment_id":"10156282327890294","commenter_b":"screw u u hateful witch\\\\","commenter_a":"Society isn't the problem.
