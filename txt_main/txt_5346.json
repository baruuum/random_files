Reasonable- yes.","commenter_a":"It seems as though the Founding Fathers knew something like this could happen, and in the Constitution under the 9th, and 10th Amendments gave each State the right to Sovereignty. State's that \"believe\" in the Constitution should be able to break away from those that want excessive government control, and socialism! the de-centralization of power is essential to the preservation of \"Freedom\", Washington has no more right to control us than London does. There is a reason we are defined as \"States\", and not Provinces. we are sovereign state with our own constitutions. Our union was formed as an agreement between the States. Texas itself made it part of the agreement to join the union that they could leave at anytime. America was founded as a Confederation. Abraham Lincoln destroyed our states rights.

There's nothing we need from them but they rely on everything from the USA. We've bailed them out so many times and the American Government is making taxpayers flip the bill for Mexico's $50 billion bailout.
