The only difference is that its unique and stands out a bit because it's so absurd. I'm still going to have to fun.","commenter_a":"I feel like I am constantly defending Hartford - telling people how far the city has come, and all of the neat things there are to do here. But this? This, I cannot defend. I was super excited for this stadium, and now, for the first time, I am truly embarrassed for and by this city that I have grown to love. Temporary attention that derives from a stupid name doesn't breed long term community commitment. It just gives jaded locals more things to complain about, instead of taking pride in their city.
