It's not the gun it's the person that picks up the gun that is the problem. If you would allow gun safety in the schools, like sex-ed, there would be a lowering in accidental shootings.","post_message":"While Everytown's ad message is all about being and safe with guns, the ad, amazingly, disregards basic fundamentals of safe gun handling.
