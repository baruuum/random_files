And back off gun control laws won't stop criminals or terrorists from getting guns. Your gun control laws only harm law abiding citizens and get people killed wake up. More states are banning gun control laws. I'm moving to Arizona. They have no gun control laws and have Constitutional carry. No permits no waiting periods no finger printing. Just a simple and quick background check and I'm free to get my gun. And I will buy loads of AR 15s and other types of guns. Gun control = death","commenter_a":"I don't see what the problem is with strict background checks and a ban on assault rifles. This guy was under investigation by the FBI twice for suspected terror affiliations. A background check would have certainly stopped him from obtaining such a weapon. Noone wants to take away anyone's guns, just keep them out of the hands of lunatics","post_message":"Americans were shocked and disgusted to learn of another act of terrorism on our soil. But calls for more gun control are a desperate attempt to create the false illusion that government - and politicians - can keep us safe at all times."}]
