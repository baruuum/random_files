In addition to Turkey, Camp Zaatari in Jordan has received tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.

Guess what: circles of female friends/colleagues will ALSO make misandrist comments about their boyfriends and men in general. The difference? Their remarks are treated as levities and never deemed sexist, whereas men are pilloried for supposed misogyny. Double standards, anyone? Woman to her friends: 'No, I don't do any DIY. I get my man to do that!' (Socially acceptable). Man to his friends: 'No, I don't do any house cleaning. I get my woman to do that!' (Misogynistic).","post_message":"Sometimes leaving a job is easier than standing up to sexism â€“ so what can women do about it?"},{"comment_id":"10152957985436316","commenter_b":"Ignorant bitch.
