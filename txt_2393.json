The media should try to hide the identities of poor kids like this baby. She definitely needs shooting a few times at least.","commenter_a":"I have not seen the video nor do I want to. Y on earth is it here for everyone to see!? What is there to gain from displaying a horrific video of a child being abused? The story should be published but when this poor child grows up and sees that this video has been seen by millions how do u think he/she will feel? Hope this cow rots in hell.","post_message":"WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO"},{"comment_id":"10153243300499087","commenter_b":"She's a flaming idiot","commenter_a":"She is one sick BITCH !!!!","post_message":"\"I am a devout, practicing Catholic.

If that kid was crying in the middle of some restaurant & the owner told the mother to leave for the sake of the rest of the patrons he'd be applauded.
