I would also like to know how to find out who in Congress reported for work when Congress was in session. I would like to know the Congressional schedule, pay, vacation time, healthcare benefits including what company handles their care. I would like to know of any other benefits they receive, as an example- I believe there is a gym in the Congressional building. These are the questions I want answered. Please direct me to the places I can find these answers. Thank you and your team for the hard work and excellent reporting all year. I become informed by the you and sound very smart as I share it all. Hah! Rest up and enjoy the holidays.","commenter_a":"We will need you more than ever in 2017.

Interviewed by Howard Stern in 1997, Trump had the audacity to make the incredible claim that by risking his schlong to venereal disease from his sexual peccadilloes, his courage matched those who gave their lives facing mortar fire and bullets across the sea. Speaking of his sexual exploits, Trump bragged, been so lucky in terms of that whole world. It is a dangerous world out there. It scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam-era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.","post_message":"Crooked Hillary Clinton has lied from the beginning regarding her emails, and server. President Obama recently defended Crooked Hillary - saying she did not endanger national security. He also said ISIS was contained last year! Crooked Hillary will NEVER make America great again!"},{"comment_id":"829608320409843","commenter_b":"She is disgusting!","commenter_a":"I'm warmed by the tolerance of the libs.

Nope."},{"comment_id":"489292257897396","commenter_b":"As long as yours dangerous people out there with weapons there's no reason to take away mine. If you take away all the guns from law-abiding citizens all you will have left are criminals with guns and there's no way to get all of those guns away from them","commenter_a":"What's the point in saying this every time and never doing anything about it? Of course, more gun control. Giving guns to the general public is fucking stupid.","post_message":"Once again, America needs to answer this question..."},{"comment_id":"10154713916667446","commenter_b":"It's her normal way.
