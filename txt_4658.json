But I never understood the hate directed at what seems to me to be a decent human being that threw his actions has shown hes willing to help anyone.

They want good jobs and a dependable future that illegals won't take their jobs. If they vote for Hillary they know their jobs will be gone. Either by illegal immigration, Middle East immigration or bad trade agreements that will move their jobs overseas. @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Love it..

Which will be legal if in a public space. Maybe you should look up Voyeur on pornhub or something and girls of all ages are being creep'd on.","commenter_a":"These sexist comments are appalling. Especially from the women. Keep letting society tell you what's proper and where your naked parts belong. As long as I'm concerned breast were designed to feed a new born. A man can do whatever the hell he wants but a woman has to be restricted to pretty much anything that might make her comfortable because revealing clothing means she's \"asking for it\" and showing her nipples, which are both called the areola on both men and females by the way, would just make men go into a frenzy. Instead of instilling this belief that breast and skin of women are meant to appeal to the eyes of men, teach men and instill in them self control, consent, and respect for women.","post_message":"Here are the nipples so scandalizing that Facebook won let us show them to you.
