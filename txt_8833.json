If you have your kid in your car it's not your time to stand your ground. Let her drive on, pull over let them go on their way, turn down another road go another way home. Don't keep following them especially when they keep randomly braking.","post_message":"UPDATE:"},{"comment_id":"602032646612178","commenter_b":"It's a very very last resort. We would have to live with it for the rest of our life. I am a responsible gun owner. Guns are meant for hunting and in case of a immediate threat on your or someone else's life only. #Berniesanders","commenter_a":"The guns themselves don't worry me. It's the people who demand having them that worry me. They never have legitimate reasons. It always boils down to paranoia and delusions of grandeur based on violence. Not the kind of humans I want to see armed.","post_message":"Multiple other vehicles were hit by gunfire, too.

Marry me haha","commenter_a":"Let me be honest here. When the California primary happens I'm voting for Bernie. But if Hilary does win the democratic side I'll vote for her. No way am I letting a republican be president. Republicans will just do what they can to get rid of Obamacare, canceling out the rights for the LGBT community, sending our troops to meaningless wars. Hilary might go to war but however she might not. In the end I'm voting democrat for the presidency. A republican will just destroy this country and send us to hell. Not voting for democrat cause Hilary is it is voting for a republican.","post_message":"BREAKING â€“"},{"comment_id":"1676754379239687","commenter_b":"Bramden whos god bitch","commenter_a":"What a dumbass. It just shows how little thought he's put into what he's saying. The environmental impact alone would be devastating. My problem with Trump is, if he were somehow to get elected, when he didn't get his way he would just say \"I'm going back to my life as a billionaire where I get my way and everything has a price so I can have what I want\". He's made that statement in one of his speeches. He said \"you might not like my statements and I may not get elected for them. So what, I'll just go back to my life of wealth\".","post_message":"How would Donald Trump crack down on ISIS as president? Let's just say he has a bold plan.
