I hope that you will agree that the system has removed a majority of our \"Black\" men who would physically engage in battle with the injustices. They are being removed from society and that weakens us as a people. They are imprisoned for a greater length of time, killed in unlawful ways right in our faces (bullets in the back, strangled and held by more than one, ect...). A great majority of our women are now out and about alone and really can not defend themselves physically against the powers that be! In addition I see more \"Black\" women, more than ever going to be the next victims of murder. This leaves our children more venerable than ever before!","commenter_a":"It would of not been like that if a man was in the car with her!","post_message":"It may not be in the way that she thought she would, but she has, indeed, changed history."},{"comment_id":"10153064195022377","commenter_b":"This lady is destined to be behind bars.
