Evil cannot be cured by any medical means, can not be rehabbed by any therapy or therapists; its bone deep imbedded and what creates their DNA. The ONLY means of eradicating this evil is to permanently remove their existence from inhabiting the earth. Once removed, incinerate the physical carcass so there is absolutely no way of the evil occupying an ounce of space ever again, starting with animal and child predators of all existences such as this female beast.","commenter_a":"Word","post_message":"SHARE if you wonder the same thing.

Right now there are 76k Islamic refugees that have arrived and continue to come. Barack Husein Obama has strategically placed them throughout the U.S. Now ask yourself, how long will it take before key cities fall to Islam within the U.S..? He knew what he was doing, and his plan is working due to tolerance and bleeding heart liberals. It may not be next year, however, in the near future, we will see more turmoil through Islam than anything else. Bullets and beans brother...","commenter_a":"Notice that the UN is NOT pushing to fight Muslim extremists so these people don't have to flee their homes? That they're trying to export them around the World instead? The reason is OBVIOUS. To create chaos and bring down western culture.

A Facebook user who goes by the name of Geris Hilton posted a photo with a black child, who is allegedly the son of his co-worker. What happened next, will leave you disgusted. He and his friends decided to make racist “jokes” at the child’s expense. Had it not been for Black Twitter, they would have gotten away with it.

That is scary","commenter_a":"I'm disgusted that the potential first female nominee of the Democratic Party (as Jill Stein is the first female nominee of a major political party) will have gotten there through a rigged election process, a purchased dnc, a fraudulent charitable foundation, numerous voter fraud allegations all while under investigation by the FBI. As horrific an individual as Trump is, he won the nomination far and square. He didn't cheat. The GOP didn't rigged the process for him. He appealed to the base, and won. That is the beauty and consequence of true democracy. A man like Trump deserves to win if he is honestly elected by the majority of Americans. The country will then reap what they sewed. Hillary however, through her lies, corrupt politics, money laundering through taking advantage of the horrific Supreme Court Citizens United decision, and unwavering allegiance to the banks and financial systems who almost destroyed ...","post_message":"To every little girl who dreams big: Yes, you can be anything you want—even president.

Today, I sent a letter to 162 public colleges and universities today asking them to update their free speech codes."}]
