I simply illustrate that women must figure out exactly what it is they want before complaining about how things are. I purposely let the door close on a woman because I don't always hold it for a guy. Women give me a stink face so often and I tell them it's me treating them equally. Have a woman pay for her own dinner once and see how far you get to having a second date. ... List goes on and on","commenter_a":"I've been to the Middle East. There isn't an American woman alive that can talk to me about oppression by men. Women run this country. They are the reason men wake up in the morning. I feel women in this country have an identity crisis in that they want chilvary but in the same instance they want equality. Men are tough and ravenous towards each other. You want that then don't complain when men treat you as they would a fellow man. (I want to add this doesn't apply to ALL women just the ones it does)","post_message":"Much of what we hear about the plight of American women is false."},{"comment_id":"1049399221792530","commenter_b":"A Hillary supporter should be asking themselves why they want a killer in office.","commenter_a":"A Trump supporter should be asking themselves why Putin would be interested in Trump winning the generals.
