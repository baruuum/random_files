It's completely insane that the DNC has supported her this whole time. She, along with Bush and Cheney, need to be in jail. Let's stop allowing these people on both sides to be above the law.","post_message":"The Director of National Intelligence should deny Hillary Clinton access to classified information given how she so recklessly handled it as Secretary of State."},{"comment_id":"1144542405568548","commenter_b":"@username bull","commenter_a":"Hilary should start a new centrist party for disenfranchised republicans, and the DNC should back Bernie. He stands for unions, while she slept thru Walmart union negotiations and stayed mute. He marched and protested for civil liberties while she was a Goldwater Girl. And the Clintons made shady insider trading deals with Tyson way back in the day to kick start their career. The only thing that makes her a democrat is her stance on women's issues. When it comes to war, trade agreements, corporate welfare, and dark money, she's a republican.","post_message":"\"That's what the American people are saying.\""},{"comment_id":"1129043100469880","commenter_b":"There is a woman out there thirsting for this man","commenter_a":"@username LOL","post_message":"He wants to be \"the complete father,\" and he's doing it one braid at a time.

Imagine believing that and being expected never to mention it. I actually don't mention it, because I've found that people simply do not give a fuck about the suffering of animals, and it is far too depressing to endure such conversations. But it continues to irritiate me when people say, it's fine, just don't push your views on others.","post_message":"Russell Simmons, founder of Def Jam and author of \"The Happy Vegan\", teaches us how to defend the plant-based diet that many love to hate."}]
