They want good jobs and a dependable future that illegals won't take their jobs. If they vote for Hillary they know their jobs will be gone. Either by illegal immigration, Middle East immigration or bad trade agreements that will move their jobs overseas. @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Love it..

Of course GUN voilence is down - but violence, homicides, etc are NOT. Home invasions are up though... bc criminals know responsible home owners aren't carrying any more. Please, get a clue. Guns are not the big problem, and more gun laws do NOT stop CRIMINALS. You know who gun laws hurt, responsible gun owners.","commenter_a":"Did any of you even read all the way through? Statistics clearly show that stricter gun laws prevent shootings. Look at Australia. They used to have guns. Had a massacre. Made them illegal. No more massacres. Their gun violence is almost non existent since they made guns illegal.","post_message":"So sad."},{"comment_id":"952811251478596","commenter_b":"@username how about you go fuck yourself","commenter_a":"Wow, while I agree that both parties are leading us down a rabbit hole. The fact is we have two parties that lead us in this country. The democrats have a criminal and a socialist as front runners in their campaign. So I have no alternative but to endorse the republican party. If my friend that liked this post feels that makes me anti American then I guess we don't know each other as well as I thought.","post_message":"This HAS to be said.
