As this analysis rightly points out, Oregon has some of the strictest gun laws on the books, and none of these proposed new laws would have stopped these awful shootings in the first place. We all want to stop these senseless tragedies, but using them to push unconstitutional, unrealistic, and ineffective new laws in order to win favor on the left isn’t going to help. I’m a gun owner myself, and I strongly value the rights guaranteed in the Second Amendment. The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens who strictly follow all applicable state and local regulations. I will oppose any effort to take away the rights of law-abiding American citizens to own firearms."},{"comment_id":"10153258824720329","commenter_b":"You know me too well","commenter_a":"Renda Rachel Sabrina","post_message":"WIN"},{"comment_id":"10153171511013690","commenter_b":"Strong woman always obsesses BOYS...","commenter_a":"Im guessing most if not all of those women are in prison for no other reason other than being born female.
