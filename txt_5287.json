Being a hairdresser I did lots of H/cuts on men. They wanted every hair on their head to be Perfect. It really bothered me when so many men came in the salon just to wait until the H/C was finished. They would bring young girls with them, who could interpret the English language. It was so hard for the young girls to be put in the middle to speak for them & me. This should be a wake up call due to illegal immigrants.","commenter_a":"We all know this!!!","post_message":"This frustrated sheriff just sent a huge message to America that perfectly sums up Donald J.

See the movie 13 hours in Benghazi please don't tell me that every person in that movie was lying about what happened that night. There was no reason why they all resigned? Like you yourself said maybe technically they did nothing wrong but morally ? And who was to blame ? And what happened after ? And let's not forget the laugh. I would never vote or defend the Donald but let's not call a word on cnn anything but spin for Hillary. They have not even reported on the so called technical issues with the voting errors or for what went wrong with Nevada. Seriously do you honestly think that your viewers cannot see through your crap when you are crapping too ?","post_message":"Michael Cohen is one of Donald J. Trumpâ€™s top advisors, an a lawyer.
