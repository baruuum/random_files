Guess what: circles of female friends/colleagues will ALSO make misandrist comments about their boyfriends and men in general. The difference? Their remarks are treated as levities and never deemed sexist, whereas men are pilloried for supposed misogyny. Double standards, anyone? Woman to her friends: 'No, I don't do any DIY. I get my man to do that!' (Socially acceptable). Man to his friends: 'No, I don't do any house cleaning. I get my woman to do that!' (Misogynistic).","post_message":"Sometimes leaving a job is easier than standing up to sexism – so what can women do about it?"},{"comment_id":"1275021955856646","commenter_b":"They just need to stay out of our vaginas!","commenter_a":"Talk about several steps back for women's rights.

NOT SURE YET, MAYBE. Definitely our country has had already more than enough from LYING lawyers turning politicians! After all, LYING is the job they do best and nothing else really matters to them. Talking to many Hispanic,- with common sense- good friends of mine, I found out that they all agreeing with DONALD TRUMP! And it's not because they aren't hospitable and compassionate people. To the contrary! It's because of the fact that most of these illegal bad apples in their efforts to blend in and avoid being getting caught, always have settled in their neighborhoods bringing their drugs their street gang attitudes and criminal ways with, and my friends are the very first to have been victimized by. Now of course not all illegals are bad, but some are and one is too many. That's the reason we have legal immigration so ...","commenter_a":"I'd like to know how many illegal immigrants Trump employs and has employed.","post_message":"Statement on Relationship with NBC-"}]
