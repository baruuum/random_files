Your fear is irrational and betrays you, allows you to be easily manipulated.","commenter_a":"Ok. These are Islamic extremists who believe that death in the service to their religion is the highest honor they can achieve. I'm fairly certain they've got some kind of contingency plan in place in event that their current leaders achieve \"martyrdom\". I'm just going to put that out there. \"We've killed more of their leaders\". So what? They want to die. They're promised 74 virgins in the afterlife. I'm absolutely positive there are plans in effect to appoint successors to those leaders who are destroyed.","post_message":"U.S.-led forces have killed 10 Islamic State leaders in air strikes, including individuals linked to the Paris attacks."},{"comment_id":"1541922275848239","commenter_b":"What a stupid bitch.

The same cannot be said for the vast majority of fetuses. A young fetus does have brain waves, does have a heart beat, and if left alone, an excellent chance of normal neurological function. We certainly would not be discontinuing life support in this situation on an older person.","commenter_a":"Women already have more access to healthcare than men.
