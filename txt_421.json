Maybe $8 start out and earn your raise, but not $15. If you want to make money in the food industry, become a server. Yeah, we make $2.13 and hr (yes our minimum wage hasn't changed in DECADES) but I work part time for full time pay as I call it. I work 3-5 hr a day which give s plenty of family time and can make $15+ an hr from tips off the table. That is how we pay our bills for those of you who feel tipping is dumb. My $2.13 pays the taxes and the smallest check I've gotten was 10 cents, some don't even get checks.","post_message":"\"We need you out there leading the fight ...\""},{"comment_id":"10154150775406636","commenter_b":"The House of Lords are having this overturned?

God created us ALL but the murderer was not created that way just as Homosexual was not either...a sin is a sin. The BIBLE is very clear in this. Sin is delighful & addictive & we tend to consume ourself in our sins hence why it's hard to detour ourself from sin...that's why we NEED Jesus Christ in our hearts. Jesus Christ was tempted in the dessert with everything you can think of yet he continued to tell Satan no & to flee.
