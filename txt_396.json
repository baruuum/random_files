My dad came to this country legally and at age 65 is still going strong. My brothers are so fortunate and blessed that my parents have given us this opportunity to make something out of ourselves. Seeing illegals demand stuff and act like they deserve things we Americans worked hard for burns me up inside. Illegals have no rights to anything and should be deported and forced to go through legal channels to attain citizenship like other immigrants. We need a wall or a stronger more secure border and absolutely no amnesty for these criminals","post_message":"\"Donald Trump is not a racist.\" Today, in front of Trump Tower, Donald J.

While you're at it, why don't you just keep your opinions to yourself, since that's what a nice housewife would do, right? Give me a break. This misogynist refused to give her a break.
