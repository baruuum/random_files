Girl Scouts of America need to get their crap together.","post_message":"A group of girls decided they were more interested in what the boys were doing. So, they quit Girl Scouts and started participating in activities alongside a local Boy Scout troop. Now they're fighting to prove they can do the same things boys can."},{"comment_id":"10153140551051051","commenter_b":"Absolutely. It's a broken system. What I don't get is that in any other country if you enter the country illegally, you get sent back. Why is it soo hard here for that to happen? It's a bigger problem then an illegal person killing another person. Maybe it's time to close the borders and get our country and its laws in order?","commenter_a":"deport trump to mexico...","post_message":"The man who had been deported 5 times before killing an innocent S.F. woman entered a surprising plea.
