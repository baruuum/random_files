I believe we all have a connection to god, and that means every, single, last, one of us........ No matter what race, color, sexual orientation, or faith. I refuse to believe god (a being of pure benevolence) would ever discriminate....... I believe god is the personification of good in people.... If you are gay, atheist, and black, and are someone who does good, you are far closer to god than someone who is straight, catholic, and white and spend your life discriminating and spreading hatred to those around you..... It's time to grow up, to live and let live, and to try to lead a life of compassion and understanding rather than judgement and contempt.

VERY few southerners owned slaves - only the richest - but they convinced the dumb farmers to go to war for them. Learn some history rednecks!","commenter_a":"Your ancestors didn't own a thing in their lives. They didn't own black people then and now. If someone did not willingly agree to become your slave it means you did not own them. They are their person. Unless they make An argreement with you as similar to terms of employment then you do not own then. All sales of slaves are void because you can't sell a human as property or goods. God already said Let My People Go... And so be it that was the end of slavery and should have remain that why.

He has not done anything to you. Anyone applauding a man loosing a fortune for standing up for his beliefs is soiling their own humanity. By ruining his life, you are staining your own soul. All of you are behaving much worse than anything you are accusing him of (falsely I might add). Those lambasting him are the ugly ones. I have seen much more vulgar behavior from the anti-trump crowd than anything that has been used as ammunition against him, true or not (most of it is false).","post_message":"The numbers say that Trump casinos, stores, and golf courses have suffered most."},{"comment_id":"10153320110664641","commenter_b":"her kids are black, derp","commenter_a":"As long as she is not racist and is doing good she is my sister!
