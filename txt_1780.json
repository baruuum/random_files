However, law enforcement doesn't seem to agree. The Executive Director of the Fraternal Order of Police National Legislative Office, James Pasco, was quoted by the Washington Examiner as stating: \"Any ammunition is of concern to police in the wrong hands, but this specific round has historically not posed a law enforcement problem.\" FOP's website describes the organization as \"the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, with more than 325,000 members in more than 2,100 lodges.\" #M855"},{"comment_id":"10154467987919342","commenter_b":"Ban cars.
