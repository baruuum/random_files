That's exactly WHY people are sad and sick and at war. They can't reconcile it. I have no clue why bad things happen. But I do have my faith in God. I wouldn't dismiss for a moment why you feel your way. I hope you won't dismiss mine. I just can't see Bill Nye explaining this to me?

They get off on body shaming others. They act like a strangers physical appearence directly affects them... If it does, then how pathetic are they?","commenter_a":"Whilst healthy living is undoubtedly a good thing, and being significantly overweight (or underweight) can be poor for one's health, making clothes that fit the diverse body shapes we have is not 'facilitating' an unhealthy lifestyle. It's simply ensuring that people of all body types and dimensions can dress in a style which they like, and in sizes which are comfortable and flattering to their shape. Besides, being overweight isn't as simple as being a 'lifestyle' - in many cases it can come from factors as diverse as metabolism, mobility issues, eating disorders or genuine dietary or medicine requirements.","post_message":"\"Saying that high-street stores shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù certain human beings having access to clothing, in order to make them really understand how unacceptable they are as people, is pretty nasty, right?\""},{"comment_id":"10154554439281602","commenter_b":"@username you must be a very lonely man","commenter_a":"The metal scrap yard is located on the same street as the historic Colt Factory. To pretend they had no knowledge of it's origin is BS. They should be fined and held accountable. I lived across the street from this monument for two years and while the area does have its issues, there is no reason to bash Hartford. There is a multitude of beautiful and historical architecture to see in that area if you are willing to get out of your car. Many state and local residents have worked long and hard to have the Colt area designated as a National Park. This is a slap in the face to a city that is trying to restore some remnants of it's former glory. Take the tour - learn a little history and have an appreciation for some of the treasures in our own back yard.","post_message":"\"When I first saw it, it almost made you want to cry.\""}]
