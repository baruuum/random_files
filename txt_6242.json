I like that","commenter_a":"Fabulous, great sense of humor and brains; trump is the icon of decadence under a cheap (very cheap) speech, only brainless sheeps follow him.","post_message":"“I have built a papier-mâché wall for Mexico. It costs $17.99. Fabulous!”"},{"comment_id":"10153626364206600","commenter_b":"I was TAUGHT the same thing you were taught growing up catholic but instead of just taking someone's word for it I decided to go read Gods word for myself and guess what? There are several people in the bible that God forgave for murder. Instead of just taking what your priest says and running with you you shoujd go read the bible and see what GOD sYs about it. It the end it's His opinion that counts.","commenter_a":"Murder is a sin.....abortion is murder. I have no respect for this pope.","post_message":"Pope Francis has made a major change in the way the Catholic Church treats women who have had an abortion."},{"comment_id":"10153151930717426","commenter_b":"@username there is no double standard. One group enslaved, tortured, raped and brutalized a race, and fought a war to keep their slaves (states rights). And the other called a race that did all the above to them devils. No comparison.","commenter_a":"Who cares about the names of the schools? Does it further rasicsm? No. Are kids being taught rasicsm? No. Anything can be offensive as \"being offended\" is subjective. Will we then denounce anything named after Malcolm X because he was a Muslim who believed that all black people are Gods and the white man is of Satan? Now that's offensive.","post_message":"She argues the name represents a “history of racism.” There are also two local schools named after J.E.B. Stuart as well as other schools named for Confederate leaders. Do you think this will/should change?"},{"comment_id":"10153564544001509","commenter_b":"I cannot stand her either.","commenter_a":"I find her extremely obnoxious.","post_message":"Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is trying to live on $29 worth of food for one week as part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge.

She opened the door for strangers when everyone else closed theirs. There were far worse atrocities happening in Germany and Europe before the arrival of immigrants. Xenophobes that previously had no excuse for their hate are happy to see their own people killed by minority terrorists just to justify their hatred for the rest of humanity.","commenter_a":"Merkel should be tried for treason. She is directly responsible for all of the sexual assaults and murders that have taken place!","post_message":"You can ban the burka, Frau Merkel. But what are you going to do about banning the migrant boats YOU encouraged to come and which are destroying your country?"},{"comment_id":"10154062692302439","commenter_b":"How will all the \"empowered\" women of America take this? I say there will be a revolt.","commenter_a":"Has the U S stooped so low. No gentlemen, no ladies, no gender. Just human bodies. Numb, mindless zombies.","post_message":"Another gift we can thank the feminists for. Let's see; the epidemic of single motherhood, the breakdown of the American family, the street vernacular of \"bitches and hos,\" the emasculation of men, defense of Islamic misogyny, suppression and oppression, silence on sharia, and the bone-crushing responsibility of one woman being mother, father, breadwinner, chief cook and bottle washer we owe to the feminists. And now this - one can only imagine what the likes of the Islamic State will do to our female soldiers."}]
