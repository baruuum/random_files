Congressman Jeff Duncan and I have together introduced legislation that would empower states to use their Tenth Amendment authority to opt out of the national refugee resettlement program. Our legislation requires the federal government to inform states of its intent to settle aliens within their borders, and allows governors to reject those aliens if a governor believes that the refugee presents a security risk.
