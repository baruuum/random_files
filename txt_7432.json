He is a Dangerous person , and he also has far too many enemies within the party. That is why he is surrounding himself with people he feels are loyal to him instead of people that actually have some knowledge of what really needs to be done. They are not going to forgive and forget his insults and his horrible attacks on them and their families. Ted Cruz and the gang are just biding their time until the inauguration. Pence Will be President and then the country will be run as a Christian Caliphate.","commenter_a":"Exactly right ! And make no mistake , Pence IS going to be president ! Seriously ...
