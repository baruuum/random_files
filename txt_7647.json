Yeah!!!","commenter_a":"Think about the differences in the 18 year old people now-a-days compared to then. Can you see your 16 year old neighbor going to the recruitment office to try to lie about his age to enlist? They're called \"The Greatest Generation\" for a reason. We'd have everyone trying to sue the government for various reasons rather than fighting. It is a different world we live in, with different core values in the newer generations. Even the older generations are wasting their time debating bathroom rights... THESE kids knew what was important, and were willing to give all for their beliefs. I can't salute them enough, or honor them enough, or thank them enough. And having served overseas for the majority of my time in the service, and living in Germany, I was fortunate enough to see just what the older generation of Germans felt for these people who did so ...","post_message":"We remember, and give thanks. #DDay"},{"comment_id":"10153001285494091","commenter_b":"Why have a trial for this garbage.

They dont go to places to live eg Spain. Greece. Australia etc and expect that country to cater to them. You go to a country you respect their way of life. They need to learn English. I used to love the golly on the jam jar brooches. All gone because of so called RACISM. This is a little island. Anyone with a criminal rec ord should not be allowed here and those that commit a crime need to be returned to their homeland. We pay NI out of our wages- not to support freeloaders who offer nothing to this country. What was beautiful historic church buildings-turned into Indian Temples. English Heritage is being destroyed!! Polish people have turned this country in areas to little Polands and this Government have let them.
