This young man left school in order to live - to SAVE HIS LIFE. He deserves every single thing that graduation affords, other than his actual diploma (which he will receive in December). I'm guessing there is no graduation ceremony in December, so he gets no graduation? School systems across America are failing their students every single day. Rules are made to be broken, changed or given a pass","post_message":"\"I never asked to receive a diploma and am even okay with not walking across that stage or having my name called.

I'm a nice guy. Now you're saying that other country's are doing just fine without Guns? Lol NO NO NO!!! Do you see what the hell is going on in Europe with the Muslim invasion or did you forget to Mention that part? The Europeans are telling us NOT to ever give up our GOD Giving Right of the 2nd Amendment. There homes are being invaded there women & children are being Raped & the FUKIN Government are sitting back & watching it all OH & they now have a Muslim PM. Something doesn't smell right wouldn't you agree? Just like I said they take your guns so when they come like they're doing now in Europe you won't be able to defend yourself. ...","commenter_a":"You gun loving Americans are so funny. I will bet all I have, that if one of you ever find yourself in a situation like the one this douche bag is referring to, which 99,9 to 100 % of you never will, you and your gun won't do anything but piss your pants. Guns would not have stopped this, nor any other terrorist attack, just like guns isn't stopping anything in your country, quite the opposite in fact. You won't see european people from Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels or any other high risk cities demand a right to carry guns, because we don't want to, because we know it don't work and because we are not stupid. Trump is a freaking idiot and sadly many of you Americans are brainwashed and scared so easily. I really really hate using the over used and annoying word, sheep, but that is what you ...","post_message":"At the National Rifle Association convention, Donald J.
