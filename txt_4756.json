You can choose to be a stay at home mom now, you are no longer forced.","commenter_a":"Feminism got women the right to vote, and the right to be equally taxed as men without suffering any of the consequences of their choices (like fighting in war) obviously women are indirectly affected by war too but....this devalued their job and oppourtunities as mothers, thus hurting the family structure by putting extra financial burdens on them to cover the extra tax load. This is why families cannot survive off of one income anymore (obviously there are other factors). Feminism made it seems petty and pathetic to be a stay at home mom and raise your children but it is the most important and difficult job in the world IMO.","post_message":"The work of stay-at-home moms is valued at more than $100K a year.
