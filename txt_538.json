Over 21,000 of you have sent your \"Stop Lynch\" Emergency Fax Petition through Facebook -- and your voice is being heard loud and clear. Momentum is building against her confirmation thanks to your outpouring of opposition. In fact, two previously undecided Republicans announced their intention to vote against her nomination. But you and I can't stop now. As you know, Loretta Lynch has proven herself to be an advocate for the lawless conduct of the Obama administration and not an advocate for the rule of law. That's why I'm counting on you to keep the pressure on and urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on her confirmation.

I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that oneâ€™s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial. Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University.
