Yours truly was abandoned as a newborn by a man who now he is 100% against abortion. I guess me being taken to Arkansas and being raised by an abusive stepfather (and the first few years in a shack with an outhouse and a well for water) was OK. I appreciate that I had a chance at life. But you men who think you can make decisions for women? STFU.
