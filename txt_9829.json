They should not live in the well of ignorance and they should accept other cultures. Most of the muslim managed countries are in bad shape, their contribution to the science and technology is zero. All the gulf countries were on donkeys before and now with oil they have money but the cannot compete with any one as they live with women, wine all the time. They fund money to third world country people to kill others and they sit and watch. No religion is bad, all we need is education and awareness.","commenter_a":"Who is #muhammad(PBUH) : He is the one who defended the rights of all humanity 1400 years ago.

Ya know why, cause its not your business! Stop saying ,well my birth control didn't work, blah blah blah. Its not illegal! If you don't like abortions, don't have one.","commenter_a":"What does that actually have to do with abortion? Viagra is not causing the death of a living being. It's not about hurting women's reproductive decisions. I mean, I'm all for birth control methods. Just imagine how many abortions could've been avoided if the women were using a very effective form of birth control? And, before anyone says that you can get pregnant on birth control or while using condoms, let me just state that it is over 99% effective if used properly. Although it is possible, it would be a fairly rare occurrence.","post_message":"\"I purposely tried to make it as invasive, as intrusive, as hypocritical and unnecessary as possible,\" the lawmaker said."},{"comment_id":"1552392261455878","commenter_b":"You forgot to show the filthy, disgusting women in vagina costumes.","commenter_a":"I'm sick of vagina.","post_message":"Congratulations to the women marching around the world today. We will not go back to the days when women had to risk their lives to end a pregnancy. The decision to have an abortion must remain one for a woman, not the government. And we will not go backward to a time before Planned Parenthood, when millions of women had no access to birth control or cancer screenings. We must go forward to ensure full reproductive justice for all women."},{"comment_id":"10153739079978812","commenter_b":"Waste of my energy girl..","commenter_a":"Hillary","post_message":"A new poll produced for ABC News/ Washington Post suggests negative views of Hillary Clinton have jumped since midsummer, while Donald Trump's popularity has grown more polarized along racial and ethnic lines: @webpagelink"}]
