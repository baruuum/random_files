Stop all benefits to foreigners.","commenter_a":"Foolishly, in October 2014 Italy left-wing government became the first European Union country to decriminalise illegal immigration and deploy its navy at huge expense to save migrants crossing the narrow Sicilian channel in open boats from North Africa (Libya mainly) in order to bring them to Italy and thus the European Union where most remain. The policy change, driven by a perverted mix of human decency and political correctness, was pure folly: it has acted as a green light to wannabe boat people everywhere, whose numbers soar as the chaos in Africa and the Middle East escalates. The result is an exodus of biblical proportions out of Africa and the Middle East into Europe. The Welfare System in Britain and Ireland is the main attraction for these illegals. Action needs to be taken now to STOP this Exodus!!!!!","post_message":"Forget the Greek crisis or Britain's referendum, this wave of migrant's is Europe's biggest threat"},{"comment_id":"10153055382512061","commenter_b":"That woman.
