My kids are five,three and one. They know better than to go into a wild animal pens. Plus me and my wife keep our eyes on them all the time. Hands are held too at all times. No excuses for that gorilla to be killed. The parents were neglectful and should be charged with neglect and child endangerment. That gorilla didn't ask to be in the pen.

Sad situation that should of never happened.","commenter_a":"For all of those slamming the zoo for killing the gorilla, what if it was your kid who fell in?
