When calling this election \"not by the book\" is a gross understatement. Forcing recounts in some critical swing states in a situation where the electoral vote and popular vote are completely different is a reasonable endeavor. What's absurd is how much of the establishment is willing to lie back and let this thing happen, then assure us in the same breath nothing truly terrible will come out of this administration because the establishment will prevent it. Actions speak louder than words, and the inaction of pretty much everyone other than Stein, Sanders, and Warren speaks volumes.","commenter_a":"Jill Stein, election spoiler, is going to put that money raised in her own pocket to pay her expenses.","post_message":"This Just In â€“ Just a few hours til deadline..."},{"comment_id":"978050422232298","commenter_b":"NOT A FAN of this pro-Muslim woman PERIOD!!","commenter_a":"She is the new definition of cool.
