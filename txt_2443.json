After all, employers get poor, uneducated people to do jobs that others won't do. And they can abuse these workers with meager pay and living conditions. They can violate rights without facing consequences. Could be seen as a human rights violation fueled by greed.","commenter_a":"For everyone who thinks Mexican are illegal n don't know their history the white man is an illegal..
