However, she isn't even giving Trump a chance. We gave them 8 years. I'm so grateful Clinton lost.","commenter_a":"Good answer Trump","post_message":"During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, first lady Michelle Obama said that there was \"no hope\" under Donald J.

The 2014 fudged wait list debacle resulted in no nurse or lying administrator losing a job or even pay. The VA is a corrupt leviathan in need of elimination. And with my first hand knowledge of the organization, I would put a bullet in my temple before becoming a patient in the system.","post_message":"Absolutely horrific!

As long as background checks can be skirted, the criminals and mentally ill can buy them at gun shows (in some states but no one checks at state lines!) and over the Internet (easier than you think!). You, being an upstanding citizen of sound mind, are welcome to keep and buy guns.","commenter_a":"But but Hillary and oboozo with their constant armed guards say we don't need to or have a right to defend ourselves when the violent lunatics they want to let out of prison come busting down our doors.","post_message":""}]
