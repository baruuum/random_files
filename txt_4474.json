This bill is not for or against immigration, it is against illegal immigration. Why are you against protecting the USA against illegal acts? The best thing we can do for the USA is have the exact same law for illegal immigrants as our neighbors to the south. Let us have the same illegal immigrant laws as Mexico, then there will be no thought or comments about being wrong or too tough. Yes?","commenter_a":"The vilest thing in the Congress are you sir!","post_message":"The vile legislation that is now before the Senate might as well be called the \"Donald Trump Act.\" Like the disgusting and outrageous language championed by Donald Trump, this legislation paints all immigrants as “criminals and rapists.” Local law enforcement officials, domestic violence groups, immigrants’ rights groups, mayors, faith leaders and labor groups all oppose the \"Donald Trump Act.\" This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe, and it certainly does nothing to address our broken immigration system."},{"comment_id":"1865774367000002","commenter_b":"If you think that way then you should leave as well.
