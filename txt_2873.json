Wake up, America, this is not CandyLand anymore.","commenter_a":"It is time! We have been too relaxed on this matter for too long. It is not that we do not love and welcome diversity and other nationalities and cultures into the amazing USA; however, we must have order and we must have processes in place to be proactive rather than reactive about our safety. We must take care of the people in our country first and then use the wealth that those resources will bring to help others throughout. My mother always said, if you cannot take care of yourself first, you cannot take care of anyone else and that simple advice applies here greatly.","post_message":"As president- I would be very, very tough on the borders, and I would NOT be allowing certain people to come into this country without absolute perfect documentation!"},{"comment_id":"10153129588721051","commenter_b":"Bitch, the only person rotting is you.","commenter_a":"The US has went to hell.

If you raise minimum wage to the argued $15 an hour, you would have to raise everyone else's wages the same percentage. Now that it costs more to pay workers, manufacturers now have to increase retail prices to make up the difference. This achieves nothing and you're back to square one. You get paid more, but products cost more. 1 to 1 is the same ratio as 4 to 4. Paying more money for the same exact thing is the precise definition of inflation. This mind set is why recessions exist in the countries that follow this policy.","post_message":"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America.
