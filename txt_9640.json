That was your big mistake.","commenter_a":"I immigrated from Europe legally paying my dues. Before they even gave me the visa to enter in USA I had to travel across the country and spend a day at a hospital designated by the USA consulate being checked out for diseases. Had to have a certificate from the tuberculosis center that I don't have tb.

But as soon as you think that to yourself, you realize that is a creature that doesn’t exist in nature.

It would force people with hidden income like drug dealers to at least pay taxes on their incomes. It could also rid of us of the earned income tax credit which is nothing more than welfare paid through the income tax system. It is paid to illegal aliens. Welfare payments should be made at the state and local level and not the federal level.","commenter_a":"\"Cooperation between the parties is needed and not multiple threats of vetoes\"... perhaps if the do-nothing GOP actually starts doing something instead of just saying NO all the time then the veto threats would disappear....","post_message":"The President's State of the Union address was uplifting, particularly if one is not aware of the actual facts. The economy is better, but far from good. There is a war on radical Islamic terrorists, although he won't use those terms, and we are far from vanquishing them without an aggressive stance. Tax reform is needed, but not redistribution. Cooperation between the parties is needed and not multiple threats of vetoes. Perhaps someone can play the President's speech back to him and hopefully he will abide by the spirit of his words and not the spirit of his ideology."}]
