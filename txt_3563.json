That's why they live longer on average than their male counterparts? :p Please. That generalisation is painful to read.","commenter_a":"\"... an air of misogyny among her predominantly male colleagues...\" Basically, trivial nonsense that women want to incessantly complain about as always. Guess what: circles of female friends/colleagues will ALSO make misandrist comments about their boyfriends and men in general. The difference? Their remarks are treated as levities and never deemed sexist, whereas men are pilloried for supposed misogyny. Double standards, anyone? Woman to her friends: 'No, I don't do any DIY. I get my man to do that!' (Socially acceptable). Man to his friends: 'No, I don't do any house cleaning. I get my woman to do that!' (Misogynistic).","post_message":"Sometimes leaving a job is easier than standing up to sexism – so what can women do about it?"},{"comment_id":"580872065400762","commenter_b":"She is a big mess","commenter_a":"Dress by Radical Christian Dior.","post_message":"LOL!

Trump is a sleazebag so regardless of whatever Noble reasons you may have... The end result is still the same. Let me explain to you about how Germany does things. They have what's called social democracy. Everybody gets Healthcare everybody gets an education not just the wealthy. Donnie's cabinet controls more wealth then 95% of the country and you honestly believe he is going to do what's best for America. You're a bigger fool than I could have imagined","commenter_a":"You people are more ridiculous than I ever imagine... What are you think she's going to do privatize public education... The woman barely has a clue as to how the education system works in the first place she has no real understanding of Education in general and yet she's going to revolutionize education in America... Sure she is... Another far-right right hair-brained scheme to put dollars in somebody's pocket","post_message":"Ignore the noise!"}]
