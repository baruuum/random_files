He's the best president we've had, he's very intelligent, he's done an amazing job considering the racism and obstructionism from the republicans. Carson is mentally challenged and there's something seriously wrong with him. Stop focusing on color and start looking at ability and integrity. Obama towers over Carson in every way.","post_message":"Dr. Ben Carson accuses President Barack Obama of never living the black experience. â–ºWatch last night's full episode: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153544587506350","commenter_b":"Real women dont need all that!

We've been at war with Muslims for over 10 years. There is such thing as an enemy. Nothing racist but anybody who is stupid enough to follow a man made book and then kill on behalf of that fairytale should be executed. If I invite you into my home and you disrespect me and my family, I'm going to kick you out. Same thing with Islam. Western nations opened the door to HELP THEM, not to get FUCKED BY THEM, and people are starting to get sick of it. It's likely best if all that do not want to embrace the culture of their host country go back home where they can lop off heads all day long and molest children","commenter_a":"How stupid are you? Focusing on Americans piss ass shootings? Look at the big picture as you support Islamic terrorism and put it on a pedestal. Animals trying to get nukes and you are worried about a couple gun nuts. They are devouring Western Europe and you pick the flea off of the dog to focus on. That's why Liberalism is a mental deficiency - focusing on the flea on the dog instead of the dog.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"979572065469181","commenter_b":"They need to pay taxes!","commenter_a":"If you bunch of socialist morons would adopt the fair tax it would do away with this along with the burdensome irs but yall don't want real answers just partisan socialist big govt","post_message":"It's time for them to start paying their fair share."},{"comment_id":"10153073313318445","commenter_b":"The queen only has a cheeky one tho!","commenter_a":"Come on America if the queen can have it.
