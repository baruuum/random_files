Meeting with the Mexican President first and finding common ground, while she stays home and refuses to speak to the American people. Mexico will pay for the wall.

In the 1940's, many Japanese were US citizens, and living here already. Their internment was a knee-jerk reaction to a very real fear that the Empire would try to invade our country with help from loyalists living here. Today, there is no nation threatening invasion, but rather a rogue terror group looking to radicalize ideological adherents within our borders, and inspire them to randomly murder us. Trump has suggested that we not allow any more people from Middle Eastern areas known as incubators for terrorists UNTIL we have much better means of sorting out the radicals from the legitimate refugees.","post_message":"This is one of the most powerful segments we've ever seen.

There are several people in the bible that God forgave for murder. Instead of just taking what your priest says and running with you you shoujd go read the bible and see what GOD sYs about it.
