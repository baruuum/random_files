Most murders of women are by men as are rapes. Women are often expected to wear short skirts and behave in what men deem a \"feminine\" way on TV and in many businesses. An excellent example is Fox news.","commenter_a":"I think this poem/speech misses a huge issue and ignores the obvious. Humans as a whole are failing. This isn't just a man's issue. I see, daily, women tearing other women down. Calling them the same things you hear. It is a problem from all sides. We have failed to raise children with respect, love, and caring. That is the issue. To suggest it is only males is dishonest. We should accept it is a societal issue and not a male/female issue.","post_message":"She’s a “dangerous\" woman because she dares to speak her mind in an online community that openly harasses, disparages, and threatens women.
