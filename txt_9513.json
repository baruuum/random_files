That is against the law. All people must be made to show ID to make sure illegal immigrants are not voting and to make sure nobody votes more than once. It is simple common sense. For the very rare citizen who may not have ID they can assist them and pay the fees. It would only be a very few people. But everybody must show ID to vote and prevent voter fraud.","commenter_a":"Why do judges think only black people don't have IDs and considering everyone needs an ID for just about anything else, why would anyone not have an ID? All this law does is make sure there is not voter fraud...so in essence this ruling shows me that the court wants voter fraud, it's the only thing that makes logical sense. I think it may be time for other countries to oversee our democratic process or we need to stop telling them we will oversee theirs because we obviously have no moral high ground to speak on the subject in other countries.","post_message":"Unreal."},{"comment_id":"1269059086447452","commenter_b":"Can you imagine how outraged the freeloading Obama brown nosers minion would be if that would be the Obama girls.","commenter_a":"But the images of the Obamas as monkeys is ok?","post_message":"Sen.
