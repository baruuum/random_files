I believe in equality, rights and fair treatment of all. Men, women, and all races, but I'm not a feminist. I support my family the best way I can now which is to stay home and take care of them. My children are smarter and safer with me here, plus they have a structured living environment. I plan on getting a p/t job when they both start full time school but as for now this is where I'm needed.
