People can fly here, come on boats and come via Canada or Mexico. The president has deported more illegals than any other president. Frankly the wealthy prefer to hire illegals to watch their children, clean and build their homes and other jobs because they do not want to pay minimum wages and want them to work as slaves in the farms, restaurants and factories. Put the blame where it belongs, on the 5%ers that are reaping the benefits of immigrants. They get you passed at the victims rather than themselves. If you want change you have to vote for someone brave enough to address the issues and actually formulate and execute a plan. Perhaps Bernie who actually addresses the issue. Voting for billionaires backed by the 5% will not resolve any issues.","commenter_a":"Obama better back off, he is allready in it for Treason","post_message":"Franklin Graham just delivered a MASSIVE message to Obama and the left about jihad and what it means for America... liberals are furious, but over 100,000 people have \"liked\" what he said on Facebook.
