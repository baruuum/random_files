But doggier....she \"kept\" you. She got you back. By completely NOT ANYTHING like what you thought you married. She's an evil, money-hungry, evil, liar, in a position in government she shouldn't even be a janitor that empties her garbage can, ugly (well, she's always been ugly) and a moral-less female. So I guess it does end up how it should be in the end. She should sit in jail the rest of her life. You two are the epitome if what a marriage should not ever be. And you sound proud!

If they have children born in other countries, they get it. Now here is the un- requested bonus kicker: If they have a\"900\" series TIN, file taxes, & claim their children; even children residing in Mexico or other countries who have never been in the US, they can apply for the Child Tax Credit & get it. All they need is a TIN for each kid. The IRS is the largest remitter of funds to Mexico.
