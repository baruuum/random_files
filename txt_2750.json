Why does Trump only need 53% of remaining delegates to get to 1237 delegates and Lyin' Ted need all but 50 delegates or 92% of the remaining delegates? You may also want to got to real clear politics and recheck your poll.","commenter_a":"Contrary to the media narratives -New York is not the center of the Country - so, It is not a big deal to win your home state. The cheer leaders want other Northeastern States to fall in line behind New York. Conservatives believe that the voters in other Northeastern States have a mind of their own. This is also not a big deal win for Trump because of the all the votes cast for both the Democrats and Republicans running in the NY Primary, only 20% of the Vote went to Trump, even with his, so called, big victory... Which makes it clear that no Republican running is likely to win NY in the General Election. So - this Primary has very little significance for who should be the nominee.","post_message":"Donald J.
