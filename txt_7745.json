Hillary is so loathesome and widely despised, she probably would have been gone long ago if not for that armed security. I, OTOH, just recently bought my first gun and didn't piss off anyone enough to want to kill me. I like to use that famous Japanese quote in WWII as to why they didn't even consider invading the U.S. - \"Invade the U.S.? Impossible, there's a gun behind every blade of grass\".
