The bacteria is mutating in two ways: one strain of bacteria lacks the primary protein used in the vaccines; the other strain has new proteins. These are found in Europe, Japan and elsewhere @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Vaccines can force the bacteria to mutate, did you know that? 100,000 Americans have gotten whooping cough in the last three years. 32 babies have died. C.D.C. scientists speculate that the current vaccine may be helping to drive the bugs’ evolution. “The fact that this happened so quickly, to the proportions we’re seeing now, clearly suggests some selective pressures ….

And neither does 90% of our Democratic Charter making up close to 3000 people. We are NOT voting for Hillary Clinton. The DNC should have let the election alone. You won't hear about it in the media or see it in the polls but MANY Democrats are pissed off at their party for rigging the election for Mrs. Clinton.
