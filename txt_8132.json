So she took time away from her family and herself (vacation days) and exposed her colleagues when sick. How smart is that. Bootstrap childbearing.","commenter_a":"About time, but still not enough.

I know there is no way Hillary's home had anywhere near the \"Defense in depth\" that the government has. She decided to run her job from her less secure home. She brought it upon herself.

Enjoy your bondage sir. Maybe try to forgive \"white\" America for its oppression and causing your \"struggle\" from 1960. Today, In this Great Country, Freedom is a choice, along with all its wonderful benefits. I beg you sir to chose it, its so much better than your aged and historical mind of past racisms and injustices. I look at your page and I see hate and division and lies, man and it saddens me. We're Americans and the media has us divided. I hate that. Its a new day bro, leave these young kids alone with your junk, let them grow up in a world without your racist wounds from the past. I shame you and the media for this junk. I have spoken my heart, this chain is closed for me","commenter_a":"You must know, this is not about equality, at its root its about domination from a revengeful spirit. There will be no end to this until they \"feel\" whites are subservient.
