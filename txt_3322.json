How many Americans are out of work but Obama thinks it's better to hire illegals and give them driver license so they can vote. Yea sounds like he's buying votes for the Democratic party.

He suggests that Iraq should have been required to give us enough of their oil to pay for the expenses we incurred. He includes in those expenses the medical costs for our military and $5 million for each family that lost a loved one in the war and $2 million for each family of soldiers ...","post_message":"\"What she did is a criminal act ... if she's allowed to run, honestly, it will be a sad day for this country, because what she did was wrong.\" Donald J.
