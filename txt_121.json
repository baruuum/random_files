So even though we've embedded it here, don't watch it!"},{"comment_id":"10154887847131729","commenter_b":"Take your head rag with you. Ungrateful bitch","commenter_a":"You are disgrace to my country! Pack your bags and go to one of the Muslim countries where you will be treated like a dog because you are female. What an ungrateful idiot.","post_message":"Seriously?"},{"comment_id":"10154086609949270","commenter_b":"@username I wouldn't scream foul if a woman was captured simply because she's a woman. Don't ASSume that, thanks darling! They take the risk just like any other man serving. You assume that a lot of women would want to jump in to combat roles over the 'safer' ones. Some might, yes. Not all. Just like having the Ranger tab it does not mean you will be in a Ranger regiment. Women are not afforded all paths in leadership like men are. I never said the standards should be lowered, did I? Nope. I VERY CLEARLY said \"If these women could not pass at the lower standards, then they have no business being part of it. So, they didn't make the cut, and yet you're still pissed off? \". Read it again, and again, and again until you understand what I wrote. Should I spell it out in simpler terms? ...","commenter_a":"There goes the military! Fools! They already lowered the standards for SEALs because of their little 5 year project that ended in 2015! They had to lower the standards and give them \"step boxes\" to complete the courses! What a crock of crap! Even at lowering the standards NO FEMALE PASSED! Certain \"jobs\" in the military should be left to the men! Females will put soldiers lives at risk when they get shot, twist an ankle, break a nail or just have a bad case of PMS! This government is ruining everything!","post_message":"The women are the first female soldiers to be accepted into the Special Forces Assessment and Selection and could report to Fort Bragg as early as October."},{"comment_id":"923411781030392","commenter_b":"You can see intelligence in many statements and never know the color of the person saying it. If you are suprised when you find out, you need to examine what you find in yourself. Common sense ignores color.","commenter_a":"Why when I read this do I keep seeing the statement \"Black mother\" or \"Black woman\" this is the problem with racism in our country. Let's stop using the color of our skins in small comments like these. I feel like this 1 small step would be a huge step in a direction and future with less focus on skin color and more on humanity.","post_message":"Do you agree with Mom?"},{"comment_id":"484907421700536","commenter_b":"What an idiot, move to another country with the other celebrity dumbasses.","commenter_a":"His opinion matters?","post_message":"And that's not all Patton Oswald said either..."},{"comment_id":"1109027105857009","commenter_b":"As the meme says, \"If you don't have a vagina and womb, keep out of mine!\"","commenter_a":"I support Bernie. Because I can't stand either Hillary or Trump. And because he wants Single Payer health care. But the Democrats are insane to support abortion rights. We will ALL be held accountable before God for the murder of our children.","post_message":"We're PROUD to be Democrats.
