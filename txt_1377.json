The Media, Hollywood, Academia, Celebrities and the Elected Officials on both sides that have tainted and divided our country with their slanted, elitist opinions have finally been put in their place. This election was never about Donald Trump, it was about the people. Not the people the media falsely reported about and stereotyped. I was at two Trump rallies, these people were black, white, Hispanic, all ages and all races.
