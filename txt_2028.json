You didn't hear that right at all. None of Hillary's money goes to Bernie, that would be ridiculously counter productive. Duh! Both Bernie, and Hillary do raise funds for the rest of the Democratic party. This is done, to insure more Democrats get elected. That way we won't have another lame duck president. Bernie still as a very good chance, and with all the controversy, Hillary, and supporters, may have just crossed the line! Don't count chickens before they are hatched! Be ready to vote blue, no matter who the nominee. On that note, I'm voting for Bernie, it's the right choice for the majority of Americans. The wealthy don't mean a damn thing to me, as most of them feel the same about us.","commenter_a":"Wise words my ass. How can you even sit there and tell us to join together with the blatant fuckery Shillary Clinton is doing. The voter suppression. Not releasing her transcripts. Her lies. She's a corporate slug that doesn't even deserve to be in office or the government. She's as bad as the republicans. The worst part is she would probably lose to the republican nominee and y'all keep trying to shove her down our throat. What the hell are we voting for if the DNC is just gonna cheat us. Bernie or bust.","post_message":"Wise words from Robert Reich.

It's about getting control of a situation that's currently OUT of control. If we don't move forward with the current plan, than what? Yes folks we are not in the same situation, but a much worse one. SIMPLE! Think about it, they are already currently living here and paying NO taxes. Unless we can beam these people up bye my calculations, YEP, there still here. Let's look back at what was actually said, the President NEVER said he was going to legalize any body's current status, just give them a chance to apply while working on there current status. Is it such a bad idea to have these people come out of the dark?","post_message":"I've been telling people for I don't know how many years, you know it as well as I do that's what this is all about.

Both Presidents Jack Kennedy and Bill Clinton were known womanizers - both had long history of doing so Kennedy had his lovers escorted into the White House late at night while Clinton had a young woman intern give him oral sex right in the Oval office ONLY difference was that Kennedy and Clinton were Democrats while Trump is a Republican At the core of the protest is that Trump won the 2016 election in KEY states and the Democrats could not get their vote out in the KEY states Moore, Garry R - Solutions Inc","post_message":"\"Well, good did not win this election.
