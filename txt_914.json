That was it for me. Iran has already violated the 5 year ban on developing and testing ballistic missiles which was part of the nuclear deal and guess what - do nothing Obama is just ignoring it. As far as national security goes - Obama is a disaster. And now he wants to bring in 10,000 refugees from ISIS territory who can not be vetted. Obama is not good for America or Israel.","commenter_a":"CORRECTION: It is under Obama that Israel has received more defense material than under any other previous administration! And these people have the gall to call him the worst President for Israel! And with His Highness' present standing in international diplomatic circles, his voice is hardly more than a \"whisper\" in the globalized wind! It's about time that people become aware of what he has wrought on Israel's reputation.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154089645681336","commenter_b":"Seriously Paula??? Smh!
