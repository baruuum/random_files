Two people in love that want to get married would never choose someone to marry them that was not accepting of them. There are many other clergy accepting out there. Not all WANT religious rites. Civil ceremonies performed are the legal ones that count. Not one person (straight or gay) can get married in the church without that civil license first. People are getting totally out of hand on this. The church is going to do what they want anyway. What really counts is marriage is legal for all.","post_message":"Wow."},{"comment_id":"10153566353686323","commenter_b":"Paul, I live in Heidelberg Germany. The Americans have left, and the army barracks have been filled with refugees. The plan was for 1200, but we have 1900. This summer, I drove to the UK. The British press reported trouble and riots in Calais and Dover - we sailed through, in both directions. Germany has taken 8x the number of refugees than Britain. And, incidently, I find that if I post here, I often receive an extremely rude and aggressive reply from someone in the UK. I find the British to be quite aggressive, probably frustration with the pro military, right wing, Banker Government, for whom they voted.
