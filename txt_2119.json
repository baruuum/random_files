FACT!!","commenter_a":"For people who don't understand, it is not just restrooms, but women's locker rooms and showers and dressing rooms. This is not right. This is not just a trans thing, but will allow men to go into confined areas where women are very vulnerable. So, how would you feel if your grandmother, mom, daughter, sister, aunt, etc. to shower with a man next to you with only a flimsy curtain? We here in NC will stand strong. I hope our governor will continue to fight for women's safety.","post_message":"The solution here might be that the North Carolina governor could say that we don't identify as North Carolina anymore, and therefore your lawsuit against us is irrelevant."},{"comment_id":"10153559818581519","commenter_b":"I guess you Hillary Shills were just waiting for me to log back in to kick your asses right?","commenter_a":"The West Coast was MADE for Bernie Sanders...

There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems. HRC cannot denounce Fracking. Now, before you think that article that spells out how much HRC is taking in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry is another Republican smear tactic, note that it is by Greenpeace. She has to go. ...","post_message":"\"We can open the door to every person in this country again.\" —President Bill Clinton"}]
