Many have asked me if I support the republican party? Here is a letter someone sent to the RNC. You be the judge. Dear Representative, From the time I was able to vote I voted republican. I am 80 and have a great deal of respect and influence with hundreds of senior ball players who also network with thousands of others around the country. I received your questionnaire and request for money and strongly agree with every question as I have since Obama was elected. Unfortunately the one question that was missing is “What has the republicans done for the American people?” We gave you a majority in the house and senate and you never listened to us. Now you want our money. You should be more concerned about our votes not ...","post_message":"About 20 protesters were arrested on Thursday night outside a Donald Trump rally in southern California, where the Republican presidential front-runner was vowing to get tough on illegal immigration.

I do not hate Muslims I hate that there are Muslim extremist that are going against Israel and want to take what is theirs and deny them their rights. God gave them Israel and Jerusalem is their capital city. Muslims do not worship our God and they want to kill those that do not worship their God. So?","commenter_a":"Amen!!

Let's see, when in office 1 went on trial for impeachment. The other has numerous investigations against her for treason, putting our national security at risk multiple times, accusations of selling American uranium to Russian companies in exchange for massive donations to \"The Clinton Foundation\" who was soliciting funds to send to the Haitians who were devastated by one of the worst earthquakes in history, yet only received a small fraction of what was raised......and while consumed with sealing her deal with the Russians, neglected action in Benghazi which cost the lives of US soldiers......... So, I don't know what Trump will do, but if I had to pick between the lesser of two evils, I would say you can't get much more evil than that witch who camouflages ...","commenter_a":"We truely don't want him in our state.

Pretty swell place for sure. Ocean breeze, beautiful homes, and packed out with America’s top 1% of the 1%—you must be in your element. And golf? I’m sure you’re playing so much golf, you’re getting almost tired of it. But then, you never tire of golf. You just seem to tire of that “Presidency thing.” My neighbors in Louisiana aren’t having it so good, Mr. President. They are underwater—again. Historic floods that have impacted or destroyed 40,000 homes and left thousands of families homeless are sure ruining their hopes for a summer vacation this year. Probably will take away hopes for a summer vacation next year as well. Their once nice homes are now waterfront property. In fact their homes don’t just front the water—they are IN the water and the water is in them. I realize that in the ..."},{"comment_id":"10157024443115354","commenter_b":"But you'll let your politicians scrub the term \"illegal alien\" from your laws!!!
