All the smelt live in temperature controlled tanks at UC Davis... to the tune of about $2.5 million tax payer dollars per year. THE SMELT ARE GONE, no matter what they do in the delta. If it weren't the smelt, another fish or animal would be chosen to take its place. We're suckers... hook, line, and sinker! Israel had severe water shortages too... they are now able to be a water exporter. They built reclamation, desalinization, and now have more than they need. California is building an f'ing bullet train to nowhere! But, what if a smelt got pulled into the desalinization plant intake?","commenter_a":"Maybe if our state government quit selling our water rights to Evian arrowhead dasani etc we wouldn't have this problem","post_message":"BREAKING NEWS: California water regulators adopted sweeping, unprecedented restrictions Tuesday on how people, governments and businesses can use water amid the state's ongoing drought. abc7.la/1QkO1GA"},{"comment_id":"10154038979953279","commenter_b":"Very simple by democratically changing the Congress /Senate, and local states governments with stateswomen /men that supports Bernie's and we the people's agenda. If you think outside the subjugated status quo box where you live it is possible to allocate the economic resources where we want it to be instead of for example spending trillions on wars and then passing a debt bill to we the people so we paid more to wall street. Simple enough. We can even pass legislation specifying since that Iraq war was illegal due to lies for greed we can write off that illegal debt and don't paid to wall street. Hmm just brain storming the possibilities once we change the Congress, Senate, and Bernie is our POTUS. Just follow THE PANAMA PAPERS.","commenter_a":"Hillary is Cynical.
