And how about Hillary supporting his bill and explaining that black people are \"super predators\"? Now we have a problem with unemployment. People are fighting for jobs, and Obama and Clinton want to allow THOUSANDS of immigants in our country to expand the fight over jobs. Illegal Mexicans are being hired before you or I because they are cheaper. Democrats have done none of you any favors.","commenter_a":"Truth. What gets me is that the Dems get elected in these cities then the voters blame Republicans for holding them back.
