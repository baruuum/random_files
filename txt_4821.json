Of course GUN voilence is down - but violence, homicides, etc are NOT. Home invasions are up though... bc criminals know responsible home owners aren't carrying any more. Please, get a clue. Guns are not the big problem, and more gun laws do NOT stop CRIMINALS. You know who gun laws hurt, responsible gun owners.","commenter_a":"Did any of you even read all the way through?
