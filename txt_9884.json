Kill them, kill their supporters, and don't stop killing until they are neutralized. Chivalrous rules of war are for opponents who will reciprocate. Virtue without reward is foolish. This is NOT a US problem. If the Muslim world objects to ISIL they have one, only one, way to show it. Kill them. That's what war is for. ISIL are winning because they have the guts and the passion (to borrow an Oriana Fallacci phrase) to stay in the fight. Their opponents lose because they are weaklings.","post_message":"\"The glories of Syria are now off-limits to Western visitors, reduced to rubble by Assad and Isil.
