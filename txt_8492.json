If you have to use illegal immigrants for less than minimum wage in order to make your business work, you do not deserve to be in business. Americans are gonna have to learn to put down the bag of cheeto's and do some actual work or these immigrants need to be legalized,be paid a fair wage and pay taxes like the rest of us. When they try to do what they do with TV's and cellphones and have it made with slave wages in other countries,we need to not allow them to sell their products here or fine them to the point of it not being overly profitable by doing this. With that being said ,same needs to be done with TV, cellphone,shoes,clothes etc. People being used as slaves in order for these companies to make major profits and so everyone can afford these ...","post_message":"Turns out America's food production relies heavily on immigrant labor, and our farmers are NOT pleased."},{"comment_id":"1101969979880290","commenter_b":"@username and @username You are both aware that faith is not a verifiable thing,correct?

That tool didn't \"destroy\" anything. He just confirmed how idiotic the Obama administration is and how clueless they are when it comes to guns. He says the guns were legally purchased in California, but then says if there were \"common sense gun laws\", terrorists would change their mind about committing acts of terrorism, completely ignoring the fact that the legally purchased guns in California were purchased under the \"common sense gun laws\" you faggots have been calling for!!! Here is a question, have common sense pot laws prevented any of you jackasses from buying and smoking your weed??
