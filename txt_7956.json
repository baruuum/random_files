When she decided to make \"her\" body a home to another human being it stopped being \"her\" body and it became \"their\" body. And as that other human being is incapable of making decisions for itself, that dumb cunt sucking poisons into \"their\" body should be jailed until the other human being is freed. Then the dumb cunt should be put in an air tight room and have the exhaust of a semi pumped into it.","commenter_a":"No,it's not her choice.Since it's obviously to late for an abortion,and she cant' control her substance abuse;she should be incarcerated until the birth of the child.The child should be then taken from her and given the best possible foster care. Hopefully the child is ok.In any case,she should be charged with child endangerment at the very least and remain incarcerated until she's no longer able to reproduce.They should also find the father of this child to find out if he is either complicit in this endangerment or is morally able to care for the child.","post_message":"What do you think?
