Nothing racist but anybody who is stupid enough to follow a man made book and then kill on behalf of that fairytale should be executed. If I invite you into my home and you disrespect me and my family, I'm going to kick you out. Same thing with Islam. Western nations opened the door to HELP THEM, not to get FUCKED BY THEM, and people are starting to get sick of it. It's likely best if all that do not want to embrace the culture of their host country go back home where they can lop off heads all day long and molest children","commenter_a":"How stupid are you? Focusing on Americans piss ass shootings? Look at the big picture as you support Islamic terrorism and put it on a pedestal. Animals trying to get nukes and you are worried about a couple gun nuts. They are devouring Western Europe and you pick the flea off of the dog to focus on. That's why Liberalism is a mental deficiency - focusing on the flea on the dog instead of the dog.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154403631241509","commenter_b":"Soooo she will be participating in the great invasion Day for sure then..you people are true life devils and still till this day it shows......GO BACK TO THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS !!!","commenter_a":"She's clearly in love haha with money","post_message":"Mariah Carey is set to marry an Australian billionaire."},{"comment_id":"10153877851737217","commenter_b":"A girl has no name","commenter_a":"Don't you mean 'so called' Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.
