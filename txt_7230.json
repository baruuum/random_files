Don't let government fix anything. All they do is break things.","post_message":"Too many working families in the Midwest have been left behind because of the outsourcing of American jobs. I led a letter with Rep. Debbie Dingell and 24 other colleagues to urge Congressional Leadership to expand opportunities in manufacturing communities harmed by outsourcing.

People pay more for organic produce, unsoiled produce is just as valuable.","commenter_a":"The farmers did it to themselves.

And in the same way Reagan kept his word by bringing home the hostages, I promise to secure the border and solve the immigration problem. I went on to say I'd protect the American people, their lives, their jobs, their health, and their children in the same manner I protect my own. I told her audience I was in love with America.
