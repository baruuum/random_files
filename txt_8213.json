Those kid's were way out of bounds for doing that. But I assure you, no citizens of the United States of America are being threatened of being deported. Only illegal immigrants of any color, race or religion. Its already the law. It has been for a long time. Its just not been enforced properly. The media tries to spend it in to hate. Its not hate, although there is anger for what were allowing to happen to our country. I personally only hate terrorist. No matter where they come from. Thats why we need to band together all American citizens. We have band together against a corrupt government, illegal immigration and these terrorists. Foreign and demestic. If we can't come to terms with that as a people. See it for what it is. Than im afaid all is lost.","commenter_a":"No they don't. You continue to try and make it about Trump. It does however have a lot to do with you. The media and the government. This is your( collectively) propaganda. To continue to divide. Its not working. Not for the majority. People listen please. They are lying to you. To push their naritive. If you actually listen to Trump. Not just the out of context sound bites they feed you. He and people who support him want unity more than anything else. For America. Then we can focus on everyone else. But we have a serious problem at home to deal with first. We have to let white, black, left, right and what ever else America go!! And realize we the people. All the people. We the people of this great nation are on the same team. Thats what we are missing.

She just gave America that fake smile like she always does and then pretends everything is just perfect. Give me a break!
