Bernie Sanders has been consistent with his message throughout his career from climate change to #LGBT rights. @username not only voted in favor of the Iraq war but she also played a large role destabalizing the Middle East in Libya and Syria as Secretary of State. I hope New York, California, Pennsylvania and the remaining states get out and vote for Bernie Sanders before the FBI indicts @username over her mishandling top secret information on her private server. We need honest leadership not warmongers who destroy entire nations with irresponsible policies. Vote for peace! #FeelTheBern #BernieSanders2016","post_message":"It's understandable that Americans are angry.

The hookworm releases enzymes that actully turn off parts of your dna that determine food allergies and other autoimmune diseases. It's in the worm's best interest to keep the host able to eat many things so that the worm can enjoy them, too.","commenter_a":"Tina Pak","post_message":"A research powerhouse attempts to solve the huge mystery of why food allergies have been skyrocketing in recent years."}]
