Our high levels of foreign aid and international development is only the beginning. We need to stop bombing other peoples countries and begin accepting a LOT more refugees. ------------------------------------- \"Voting yourself out of the EU has not solved that problem at all and it will most certainly not lead to more non-EU migration\" But with control of our own borders we can stop priority status for Europeans over non-Europeans and decide our immigration policies at election time. ------------------------------------- \"And if you are so concerned by population control on your island\" I'm concerned about population control on earth.

(although the odds are low of that ) .. I'm just saying it's funny how I feel it would be different if this many bodies were found and they were female. I don't like how ppl instantly assume this many men just walked into the river accidently drunk.. especially when their have been bodies found in garbage cans and other areas as well. It may be a big city but a serial killer theory is plausible and cannot be excluded when this many individuals seemingly \"walked into the river\" accidentally. The men are young mostly college aged looking ... if someone is targeting them it could be for a variety of reasons. The only thing they seem to have in common is they ...","commenter_a":"I can't be the only person that's starting to get the impression there may be a serial killer in Pittsburgh","post_message":"JUST IN: Skeletal remains found earlier this week in a trash can have been identified as Dominick Brown, a Penn Hills man who went missing in 2012, his family tells Channel 11 News."},{"comment_id":"767530393325420","commenter_b":"If employers are fined and punished who hire illegals and no welfare benefits were given to illegals, they'd have no incentive to be in the US and they go home..","commenter_a":"Senate Democrats need to stop being obstructionists!!!
