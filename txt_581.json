Since there isn't much talent there.","commenter_a":"Sure, Sarah made Tina famous and rich. But Tina helped do the same for Sarah. I believe Sarah is laughing all the way to the bank....just as much as Tina is. Sarah did look a bit disjointed at the endorsement and Tina jumped on the opportunity to mock her. But Tina....sorry. You failed miserably. Didn't laugh at all. SNL is just sad. Don't watch any longer. The constant right bashing is boring and predictable.","post_message":"You saw this, right?"},{"comment_id":"499497803543925","commenter_b":"That shady bitch, I would never go to her freaking dinner!","commenter_a":"Thank You patty for doing the right thing .","post_message":"Patti LaBelle Finally Admits James Wright Chanel’s Video Increased Pie Sales, Invites Him to Thanksgiving Dinner [Video]"},{"comment_id":"10153737001138812","commenter_b":"This lady is still working there??????????????","commenter_a":"why not go ask a Muslim cleric to marry them get married in a mosque","post_message":"Another gay Kentucky couple denied marriage license by controversial clerk: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153080762721051","commenter_b":"Set his butt on fire the next time sis..

Women are still 2nd class citizens we are expendable. The national movement has wrapped itself up in abortion rights as the only right we speak out for. Susanne B Anthony must be rolling in her grave. Shame on us for allowing this to continue. There are currently more women than men worldwide. Withhold that which men hold dear, watch how fast things change.","post_message":"This woman's husband repeatedly abused her.
