Guess what? Girls are better at hiding it. I saw the video and see nothing wrong with it, she was wearing shorts, she moved her hips.

Americans REJECTED TRUMP","commenter_a":"\"Why are you really doing this?\" Despite the many rumors swirling on the Internet, the Stein/Baraka campaign genuinely believes in the power of grassroots democracy. Independently funded candidates like @username cannot stand a chance if our electoral system is rigged in favor of establishment, corporate-funded candidates. The evidence so far shows it is easy to hack many voting machines being used in elections. Aside from conducting a recount, we advocate Ranked Choice Voting and federal campaign financing, just a few solutions put forth by the Green Party in it's six-point plan for grassroots democracy.

I don't understand why they are for Hillary. She can't do a thing but lie. She will do nothing for poor and middle class. How do people not see this? ?? I am amazed at how stupid people are thinking life will be better with her doing what Obama has for 8 years. Bankrupting America and millions of Americans. WHAT has she done FOR America? ?? More. ..what has she done TO America? The red states will get it right I hope.
