Also, her derri√®re is not going to effect the shape of the intake. It is designed to handle air pressure from 250 knot IAS relative wind that at altitude could be as high as 550 knots TAS. So, what's the big deal? I think the picture looks COOL!!!","commenter_a":"I do not think so.

Anyone against common core is against preparing kids for the job market. The curriculum used implementing common core was written by the text book companies and approved by local school boards. It's OK to be angry at that but Kasich has nothing to do with curriculum so hopefully now you can vote for him again.","commenter_a":"Wake up Ohio.. vote Trump.

I saw another comment somewhere else from an actual member at the pool. This was a members (HOA) only pool where there WAS several BLACK members and was present at the time. There was a private pool party going on where the DJ that was hired sent out a tweet about was he was doing. The pool was swarmed by kids from another neighborhood with no pass and uninvited. Which is technically \"trespassing\". They was asked to leave and started a fight in which the cops was called. The police had made several requests to leave with no luck. This girl ( if you watch the full video) was asked to leave several times and told the officer \" F-YOU\" and that's when the officer grabbed her. First off she and the rest was trespassing and second refused to leave when asked. @webpagelink","post_message":"A young woman who attended the McKinney pool party gives her explanation for \"how it all began.\" Watch the full interview here: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1033161420090232","commenter_b":"Hispanics are illegals?
