If undocumented get amnesty (which can only be done by Congress), that doesn't necessarily make them a citizen. If we decide (via legislation) they should have a path to citizenship, then citizens get to vote. Your comment makes no sense, and is a total strawman.","commenter_a":"If you can't win on the merits of your policy ideas, change the system.

The same cannot be said for the vast majority of fetuses. A young fetus does have brain waves, does have a heart beat, and if left alone, an excellent chance of normal neurological function. We certainly would not be discontinuing life support in this situation on an older person.","commenter_a":"Women already have more access to healthcare than men. Show me a government funded chain of facilities specifically there for prostate cancer treatment. At any rate, cutting a living human out of a woman's body isn't healthcare and the living child certainly doesn't have a choice to be murdered or not during an abortion.","post_message":"When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body, thatâ€™s extremism.
