He would've been painted an insider since government is all he knows. They planned to trot out his rape fantasy story as well. Also, Vermont tried and failed it's statewide Healthcare for all system. He was treated with kid gloves compared to what he would've endured against the Trump post-truth machine.","commenter_a":"Sorry, Bill, but half of America already hated her BEFORE she ran. The media and Republicans have been excoriating her for 30 years. SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE--unlike Bernie, who was almost universally beloved. He would have won. Fault: Democrats","post_message":"In case you missed them, we're counting down the most popular stories on BillMoyers.com during the past year: #9 - The fact is that Hillary Clinton wasn’t unpopular when she announced her decision to run in April 2015. If you look at the Gallup survey in March of 2015, 50 percent of Americans had a favorable impression of Clinton, only 39 percent an unfavorable one. So there was clearly no deep reservoir of Clinton hatred among the general public at the time. On the contrary: Americans liked her; they liked her quite a bit. Hillary Clinton's popularity didn't start to plummet until the press focus turned to her emails."},{"comment_id":"10155170466528984","commenter_b":"Hire American instead of illegals","commenter_a":"COWARDICE","post_message":"This just in..."},{"comment_id":"897220707004345","commenter_b":"Ah yeah, 'only'!","commenter_a":"Emma Marie Hulme Bet you'd be able to shed some light on this!","post_message":"Near death survivor says all he saw was darkness"},{"comment_id":"619645721526492","commenter_b":"I bet this woman also looks good with clothes on (y)","commenter_a":"Please don't take any advise from the Kardashian's.
