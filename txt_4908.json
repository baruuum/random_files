We would never approve of someone cutting their right hand off b/c they decided they had to be a lefty. So why in the world are we letting these people mutilate themselves?!! It's not about sex it's about the brain. They need help!","commenter_a":"The man with the sign in the background has the heart of the issue correct: girls' rights matter! No way would I want a confused young man using the same bathroom at school as my daughter. These young men and women need help. I have compassion for them because they are confused. Steer them towards counseling and mental health treatment. Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero. I don't buy the \"if it saves one life\" act. The fact is the majority of suicides in transgenders occur AFTER they've made the devastating and disastrous choice to destroy their own bodies as God created them. They need treatment BEFORE they get to that point, not someone telling them they're fine as a woman when they were born a man or vice versa!","post_message":"\"I'm not the only transgender person at my school, and I won't be the last.\""},{"comment_id":"636469079877004","commenter_b":"Send her back to her own country so she can mooch off of their welfare system, not ours!

BTW: find out where the largest number of historical artefacts from the middle east, coming with an unclear origin, are traded? Don't be surprised when you find out that it is London and you you can easily find out, that it is business of billionGBP earning. Why do you think IS is destroying historical sites? So, all this happens under the control of your government, right in your neighbourhood...","commenter_a":"The people were on their way and Germany take action to relief all surrounding countries, who where not able to cope with a minor percentage of the people floating their countries. Yes, it is not easy, but Germany helps a lot of people and countries and yes, it is a massive task, but we (you and me and our governments...) have to deal with it.Why? Because we are causing the situations, why the people have to flee and have seek for shelter. So, I am living in Hamburg, my borough is called \"Bahrenfeld\" and we have a polpulation 23.000 people. Currently we have 3.200 refugee living here. And I can hardly understand, why a country, which has caused and initilized a lot of the current wars in the middle east, in order to earn oil money ----NO---- to fight terrorism (hahaaa), refuses to take part in the resposibility...Yes, my dear ...","post_message":"‚ÄúSometimes the smugglers arrive in the middle of the night and drop underage refugees off at the service station.
