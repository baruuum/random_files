I think you need to reevaluate. Perhaps it is the people who you are getting your facts from who are the incompetent ones. And since they're evidently your only source, I'd say you might want to step up your game.","commenter_a":"He's such an incompetent douchbag. 12 more months, thank God!","post_message":"Probably as close as Obama will ever come to actually admitting it."},{"comment_id":"1954618021430775","commenter_b":"It aint over till the fat lady sings,lol","commenter_a":"Mark my words, in future presidential elections, candidates will try to do what Donald Trump is doing.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10152972519324753","commenter_b":"This bitch","commenter_a":"Nathan Perez @username omg","post_message":"Anna Broom has been on welfare since she was 19-years-old since she was deemed too overweight to work.

We're past issues of legality. We're past party lines. We're into basic human dignity and the essential morality of how human beings treat each other. Black lists, registration lists, and round ups and mass deportations are all tools of countries where the rule of law has broken down and democratically designed processes have failed - BY DEFINITION. Yes, illegal immigration is a huge issue and yes, there should be systems in place to allow due process of law to happen based on merit and compassion. Targeting entire groups of people and refusing to treat each person as an individual in assessing their rights and needs is the antithesis of our stated democratic ideal.

The more that I learned about Hitler's insanity the more I realized that he copied the concept of the concentration camp from the US answer to the Indigenous people of this land. The Nazi's swastika is even taken from Native American symbols.
