Look at All Gore with his huge carbon footprint. Yes science is real and climate change is real this coming from a conservative but unless we get our house in order this country won't survive. The answer from liberals is a carbon tax. Let's see gas and electricity go through the roof and see the gap between the rich, middle-class and poor widen even deeper. You have to live what you preach and ultimately politicians are out only for themselves. There poor decisions impact the masses and we all need to wakeup. The problem with liberals is they think everyone who doesn't believe exactly like them are bigots or racists and there is no compromise. Tax and spend is not the answer the rich just find new ways to hide it and the middle class families keep falling into ...","post_message":"More proof they can't deal with facts."},{"comment_id":"10156425606485725","commenter_b":"Lol Caitlyn Jenner beat you as Most Fascinating Person.

I know correctional officer Gene Palmer has already arrested for possible help to david sweat and richard matt escape from prison. I say correctional officer, prison workers and prison staff never help to some inmates escape from prison. If correctional officer, prison workers and prison staff help to some inmates escape from prison and could be arrested add prosecutor attorney will announce charged against correctional officer, prison worker and prison staff.","post_message":"A guard charged in the New York prison escape \"knows that he made a mistake,\" his lawyer says: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153312996021167","commenter_b":"He has also said that Muslims need to be deported, whether the are American citizens or not. ðŸ˜–","commenter_a":"Brokaw makes a false comparison. In the 1940's, many Japanese were US citizens, and living here already. Their internment was a knee-jerk reaction to a very real fear that the Empire would try to invade our country with help from loyalists living here. Today, there is no nation threatening invasion, but rather a rogue terror group looking to radicalize ideological adherents within our borders, and inspire them to randomly murder us. Trump has suggested that we not allow any more people from Middle Eastern areas known as incubators for terrorists UNTIL we have much better means of sorting out the radicals from the legitimate refugees.","post_message":"This is one of the most powerful segments we've ever seen.
