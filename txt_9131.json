She also has to take a truckload of pills every day in order to make sure she gets enough nutrients so she won't have other health problems from not eating enough. Anyone doing any research on gastric by-pass will find that it's not the solution to weight loss, and in some cases, they're much worse off than before. This woman isn't so fat that she can't lose the weight on her own. The problem is she doesn't want to lose weight. If your \"want to\" isn't there, even gastric by-pass won't be very effective.
