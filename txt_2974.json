So I have to take a break.. Also I get discouraged when people call me names :(","commenter_a":"They didn't say \"get over it.\" They promised to look into it, did so, and concluded that their pop culture reference was fine and that people misconstruing it would be in the minority and no changes needed to be made. Kinda funny how you can spin a story with a contentious headline. Ben & Jerry's seemed concientuous and compassionate here, not combative and dismissive as the headline suggests.","post_message":"These folks became very upset over the name of Ben & Jerry's new ice cream flavor and demanded it be changed.

After all, employers get poor, uneducated people to do jobs that others won't do. And they can abuse these workers with meager pay and living conditions. They can violate rights without facing consequences. Could be seen as a human rights violation fueled by greed.","commenter_a":"For everyone who thinks Mexican are illegal n don't know their history the white man is an illegal.. We Mexicans always been here","post_message":"Diego Reyna, a Mexican-Canadian, said he placed the Mexican flag atop the nearly completed Trump Tower because he was tired of disparaging remarks made by Donald Trump. \"MR Trump, we did our best work, your tower here in Vancouver is premium quality, and we were a crucial part of it, not just Mexicans but immigrants as a whole,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"The insults you have said about us, have not changed our work ethics.\" Reyna says he hopes his message of \"love and unity\" will reach the Republican presidential candidate."},{"comment_id":"992191140821358","commenter_b":"Why?
