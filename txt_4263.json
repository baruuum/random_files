Esto no solo es lo correcto sino que cada análisis independiente ha demostrado que añadiría cientos de miles de millones de dólares a nuestra economía. Mantendría también a las familias juntas. Tenemos que sacar a las personas trabajadoras fuera de las sombras.

Maybe we should be concentrating on people who arnt entitled coming to this county just for the benefits and Nhs and maybe the government should be claiming back the millions we loose in this way. I don't expect Katie price or other celebs are a drain on our economy as some people who claim benefits with no intention of ever working.","commenter_a":"The benefit system isn't struggling & costs being cut because of Katie Price, it's struggling because of the generation of freeloaders who see Benefits as a career choice, people who can work & pay taxes but don't; If everyone in this country that can work had the right work ethic we wouldn't be in half the mess we are. I was always brought up benefits are for those who need it for clothes, warmth, food, the essentials - including specialist care for the disabled, people nowadays have full sky packages watched on 50\" tvs, have a social life and go abroad for holidays all from benefits, where's the incentive then to get off their backsides and go to work. Whilst I'm not her biggest fan Katie price pays much more than her fair share in tax, she's a grafter & a worker, her son deserves his benefit rights in return","post_message":"\"This is exactly why universal benefits matter. Defend the right of mothers of disabled children, such as Price, to get help, and it reinforces the rights of everyone else. That’s how society works. Strengthen one pillar and the other gets bolder; weaken one and it won’t be long before they all start to crumble.\""},{"comment_id":"10152699029652377","commenter_b":"Idiot comment of the day","commenter_a":"Top reason.
