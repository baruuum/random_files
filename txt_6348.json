I believe that a 17 year old, is not a child anymore. I believe in raising kids to respect authority not defy it. I believe in order for people to succeed in this life, they need to learn to communicate appropriately and in the correct place. This punk did none of the above and she challenged because she thought she could control the authorities in the room. There was no brutality here at all and what the Officer did probably stopped the room from erupting in violence. Go watch @username's video and read the story. It may teach you something. Hopefully, this thug learned something from all she went through, but somehow I doubt it.","commenter_a":"I watched the entire video. You had a belligerent girl who refused to put away her cell phone. She was mouthy to the teacher, the principal and then the officer was called. He asked her nicely to obey. She refused to follow his orders even after being asked several times. He went to take her out of the chair, she hung on. He did not body slam her, as reported and actually she came out of the chair pretty easily. It just looked bad because the chair fell over. The officer was completely correct and the girl was completely wrong. They better clear this officer or they will be sending a very bad message and more kids or punks as the case may be, won't listen to their teachers either. Chaos will ensue in the classroom and order will be totally out the window.","post_message":"Do you think this is a case of excessive force or lack of respect for authority?"},{"comment_id":"10152873946396045","commenter_b":"she is an idiot","commenter_a":"I think most people who don't like her are sore about her portrayals of Sarah Palin.","post_message":"Tina Fey literally gave David Letterman the dress off her back -- right there on the spot, leaving her stripped down to her Spanx, which had a special goodbye message written on them. #lastdressever"},{"comment_id":"1849864471907247","commenter_b":"Oh yea, he needs another wife.
