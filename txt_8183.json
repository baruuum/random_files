But the airline's inconsistency in enforcing those rules is the real issue. It was ok to hold the child on the way down, it should have been the same on the way back. BUT I find the attention mongering of this mom downright pathetic. Totally disgusted. Not everyone is a world traveler, and I also get confused by the ever changing rules of the sky. Seems to me the mom holding her daughter was pretty clear that now she knows the airline's policy she will have a safety seat with her in the future. No further big deal made of it, issue was put to rest. Until this attention whore feels compelled to one-up her and try to publicly shame her. Disgracefull, classless and pathetic. If the woman went on and on and on about how she should be allowed to hold her child anyway, Yada yasa ...","commenter_a":"I agree with most of you, if she has a child with special needs then they shouldn't have been seperated in the first place. Secondly if the flight attendant had let that happen and something happened, then who would've been at fault then??","post_message":"\"The attention mongering schemes of Elit Kirschenbaum, who took to Twitter last week lambasting a United Airways flight attendant for refusing to allow her to hold her disabled three year old daughter on her lap during take off, make me want to puke.\""}]
