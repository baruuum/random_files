If we can't afford social programs to help the people of this country, how the fuck are we gonna pay for a war? Not a Bernie fan, but you can't trash one candidate because \"We can't afford him\" when Trump wants to cut shitloads of taxes, and THEN try to finance a mass deportation, a war, and then a wall. Don't even get me started on how prices will shoot up on produce, as well as anything illegal immigrants touch.","commenter_a":"Honestly Bernie Sanders not winning would make me lose complete hope for the US. They are being presented with one of the most honest, genuine, good hearted humans possible, yet they prefer to give the likes of Donald Drumpf and Hillary Cliton their attention.

I bet if a person walked in and brandished a weapon he/she would be taken out by a person you hired or are in connection with you and your party that is wielding a gun. You would say its protection...... We say the same thing.... It is for Protection.... While you want to make guns illegal for law abiding citizens to obtain, you will only make it Illegal to own them. Causing a bigger issue for some. People will always have guns.
