Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught?

I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. ðŸ˜•","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"1247455158641980","commenter_b":"She's such a nasty woman!","commenter_a":"guess she needs to be held for terrorist threats","post_message":"MADONNA Tells Feminazis At DC #WomensMarch: \"I Have Thought an Awful Lot About BLOWING UP The WHITE HOUSE\" [VIDEO] @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10152829318850667","commenter_b":"I concur, Josh!
