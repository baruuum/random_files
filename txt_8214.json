These people are Muslims as maybe you are. Their ideology is to secede as supreme at any cost including the taking of life to advance their cause. Allowing 10,000 to come to this Country, and not knowing who they really are, is not a smart idea nor is it responsible. We have enough problems in this Country now with illegals and supporting them. We don't need more leaches to feed. And yes, I am a proud Southerner as you have mentioned.
