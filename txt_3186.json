I think what these kids did was dumb. Question is..\"is it only offensive to hear these words when it comes from a non black individual? Or is it also as offensive to black person if their their own race uses the word to announce their friendship\"? What up my n..... You all have heard it. Its in every horrible rap lyric. Its used daily in schools and on the streets. RESPECT IS RESPECT. there is no off time when the word is offensive or not. So its an honest question.

The national movement has wrapped itself up in abortion rights as the only right we speak out for. Susanne B Anthony must be rolling in her grave. Shame on us for allowing this to continue.
