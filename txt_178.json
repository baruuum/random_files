Aside from the idiotic general opinion of the public, I've met more illegals that really want to be here to work and provide a better life for their families. Unlike many of the current inhabitants of this country that just can't wait for the first of the month for that government check. And let's be honest, we're a country of immigrants. Seems a bit hypocritical. And on the plus side at least immigrants want their children vaccinated.","post_message":"Thousands of immigrants seeking legalization through the U.S. court system have had their hearings canceled and are being told by the government that it may be 2019 or later before their futures are resolved. The increase in cancellations began late last summer after the Justice Department prioritized the tens of thousands of Central American families and unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border."}]
