Republicans and democrats both. To work here the illegals have had to come up with a fake s.s. number and pay on every check. This is a fact. I've seen it, known people who pay into it and will never see a dime from it. Our government is full of lies. They take that money and our legal money and blow it.

The only thing more shocking than this reckless, short-sighted, last-minute gift to the extreme environmental agenda is that President Obama had the nerve to claim he is doing Alaska a favor. President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there. I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision."},{"comment_id":"10158010051555354","commenter_b":"I like the way you think. You are a strong ,smart woman. Hillary?
