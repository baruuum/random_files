Coat hanger abortions. Dirt roads. Family 'secrets'. Weapons. Vigilantes. Klansmen, those gallant white knights of chivalrous times. Tarring and feathering of \"revenues\".

Especially if they are scared that information will get out there that will harm them. I'm not saying that anybody did tamper with his breaks, all I am saying is that it is possible. Nobody cut his break line obviously because he would of known, but had some drilled a pin hole in a brake line or reservoir, then sealed it to make sure it didn't leak out while sitting stationary. Then as he leaves the drive way he is still able to brake because there is fluid there to press the caliper in, but it breaks the seal and starts to leak out and he could use the brakes so long that the hydraulic fluid is still able to pressure the system. By the time ...","commenter_a":"I am just throwing it out there but Im pretty sure if his brakes had been tampered with he would have known it after the first stop sign or stop light after he started his car....

Her girl, delivery was worse that the sound of a dentist drill and it was more emetic than aphrodisiac. The audience was truly stunned , as if they were witnessing the senile ego of a down and out prostitute consumed, devoured, by her own inflated ego turning tricks in the parking lot. Her exaggerated performance wreaked. It almost seemed cruel to not instantly cut to a commercial. It was truly wretched. Mr. Ed pissing on stage would have been a great improvement!
