Tell that to the kids who can't go to school because they can build multimillion dollar stadiums or provide tourist attractions all while shutting down schools. You grew up a sheltered white girl. I already know.","commenter_a":"They lack the testicular fortitude to do this on a Saturday night around 2 Am in Miami 's Liberty City or Overtown or in front of Snoop Dog's house in LA.
