Im pro-Trump and agree with a vast majority of his political stances; however, this wall fallacy is a dream.... a wall doesn't stop illegal entry, it only causes illegal entry to evolve.

Each time, she was raped. Noor managed to escape and made her way, mostly on foot, to a refugee camp. “The worst moments,” Noor said, “were when one man would sell me to another.

Transcription of Brain Carn’s Prophetic Word for 2016 “What happened in California would become common place in America, and an event worse than 9/11 is coming to America. The Lord says that Islam has a definite problem. They will never shake this reputation of violence from themselves. Even innocent Muslims will endure hardship and persecution in the future and no longer see America the same. @username Muslims are gonna begin to gather to cities, like Dearborn, Michigan, and form new communities that contain the populous of their presence so as to guard the backlash from White Patriotic America.

You acknowledge that there can be different factions on the left but not right apparently as well. If your main concern is the debt then you should lean more conservative as the primary goal is financial stability. Bush was not a conservative btw, he was more liberal. The main difference in policy between Obama and Bush (and possibly both parties in general atm) is \"what\" they wanted to spend money on but they both want to spend as much as they can get away with.
