I know I haven't stopped crying since Thursday and I never met the man or knew him other than his movies and music. He was a beautiful soul and will be truly missed. @username take things so out of context it's unreal and always have to make things a issue where they should be no issue. Prince was a sexy, talented, giving man and I know I am devistated and I am a fan that will truly miss him.","commenter_a":"Prince was an amazing human being for so many reasons, but really??? 1) Comparing his, or any singular death, to 9/11 is crazy! 2) Why is this a race issue? It's like saying that only us Minnesotans are truly grieving.","post_message":"Dave Chappelle once impersonated Prince for a now-infamous Chappelle's Show skit."},{"comment_id":"10153222402864705","commenter_b":"Well......let's see what happens.
