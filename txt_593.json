The reality is that he's working an entry level / minimum wage job so that's why he makes minimum-wage. I'm a disabled Marine Corps veteran myself and I spent four years in school so that I could earn enough money to support my family and give them a better life. For those that say that maybe he doesn't have the aptitude to go to college, there are trade schools out there that he would be more than qualified to go to. When fast food workers start making $15 an hour then entry-level welders need to be making $25 an hour and those that are currently making $25 an hour will then need to make $35 an hour and so on and so forth.","commenter_a":"This man risked all he had for this country, got wounded but continued to serve his country and now he gets $7.50/hour and cannot afford to support his family!!! :( While Mr. Cheney does not step his foot on the battlefield once, and his Halliburton makes nearly $40 billion dollars from the Iraq war!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can this country allow such extremely disproportionate treatment of its citizens???? I think the living wage is around $27 to $30 dollars/hour and that's what the veterans deserve....","post_message":"He fought in Iraq, but back home, he's struggling to get by.
