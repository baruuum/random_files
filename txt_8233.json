Keep replying on this joke of a feed.","commenter_a":"Do we expect Sheriff Clarke to say anything different. Why doesn't Mr. Hannity ever have some real dialogue on his show. I would have more respect for him. I have been following Mr. Hannity for about 10 years now. His revolution is taking forever. I don't think it will ever come. if Mr. Trump is elected is that the revolution. Senator Cruz is the only true Conservative. But in today's world conservatism means unyielding which is not a good thing. President Reagan would be turning over in his grave if he saw what was happening to the conservative movement in our country today","post_message":"Milwaukee County Sheriff David A.

It's like we're protesting something that happens 1 time out of 1,000,000. And nobody cares about something that happens like everyday. The media has got the people riled up about a very small issue while ignoring major problems. That's why I don't understand this movement. It's like if the government was repossessing everyone's home and moving them to refugee camps for no reason, but I was protesting the governments estate tax while ignoring people's homes being taken.","post_message":"Does the Michigan Football players' silent protest make you uncomfortable?
