Unfortunately, our stage was filled with plenty of rhetoric and shouting politicians. I want We the People to know I hear you. Although I didn’t have much time to share my common sense solutions with you on stage, I look forward to continuing my clear, concise vision with the American people as I did tonight. Even more, it’s clear that the people were listening – we gained over 100,000 friends and patriots on Facebook during the debate. I am humbled by our over 400,000 Twitter followers that made us the Most Mentioned candidate on Twitter during the debate. We the People are fighting for freedom, and tonight is proof that the American people are winning."},{"comment_id":"10153653064325575","commenter_b":"Please get rid of this POS","commenter_a":"100% pathetic - Trump 2016 !","post_message":"Talk about OUT OF TOUCH!"},{"comment_id":"1808417692765360","commenter_b":"Disgusting.. .
