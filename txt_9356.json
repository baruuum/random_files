No one deserves jail because of an unpaid weed ticket. Jail should only be for Killers, Rapists, and Burglars. Is that too much to ask?","commenter_a":"I see, so break the law, claim you're poor, and get away with breaking the law. Talk about \"privilege\". :/ Being poor is NOT a \"justification\" for not taking responsibility for one's own acts. No more than being rich is a \"justification\" for not being responsible for one's own acts. It's interesting how people complain that the rich aren't being held responsible for committing violations of the law, then claiming that the poor should NOT be held responsible. Rich person doesn't pay their taxes, they belong in jail. Poor person doesn't pay for legal fines and fees, they should just be entirely excused for breaking the law. Interesting.","post_message":"Kevin Thompson was jailed for five days because he couldn't afford to pay fines and fees from a traffic ticket.

If you raise minimum wage to the argued $15 an hour, you would have to raise everyone else's wages the same percentage. Now that it costs more to pay workers, manufacturers now have to increase retail prices to make up the difference. This achieves nothing and you're back to square one. You get paid more, but products cost more. 1 to 1 is the same ratio as 4 to 4. Paying more money for the same exact thing is the precise definition of inflation. This mind set is why recessions exist in the countries that follow this policy.","post_message":"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to pay billions more in taxes in order to subsidize the wealthiest family in America. That's absurd."}]
