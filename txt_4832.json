Many have asked me if I support the republican party? Here is a letter someone sent to the RNC. You be the judge. Dear Representative, From the time I was able to vote I voted republican. I am 80 and have a great deal of respect and influence with hundreds of senior ball players who also network with thousands of others around the country. I received your questionnaire and request for money and strongly agree with every question as I have since Obama was elected. Unfortunately the one question that was missing is “What has the republicans done for the American people?” We gave you a majority in the house and senate and you never listened to us. Now you want our money. You should be more concerned about our votes not ...","post_message":"About 20 protesters were arrested on Thursday night outside a Donald Trump rally in southern California, where the Republican presidential front-runner was vowing to get tough on illegal immigration.

Obama loves the Muslim Brotherhood , just like this mosque does . How much Wahhabist / Muslim Brotherhood money is funding Hillary Clinton's campaign ? Since when did Political Islam become a fifth column in American Politics ? Who let them in ? NAIT ( North American Islamic Trust ) is the pass through for Political Islam ( Muslim Brotherhood / Wahhabist ) political activity in America .

But I assure you, no citizens of the United States of America are being threatened of being deported. Only illegal immigrants of any color, race or religion. Its already the law. It has been for a long time. Its just not been enforced properly. The media tries to spend it in to hate. Its not hate, although there is anger for what were allowing to happen to our country. I personally only hate terrorist. No matter where they come from. Thats why we need to band together all American citizens. We have band together against a corrupt government, illegal immigration and these terrorists. Foreign and demestic. If we can't come to terms with that as a people. See it for what it is. Than im afaid all is lost.","commenter_a":"No they don't. You continue to try and make it about Trump. It does however have a lot to do with you. The media and the government. This is your( collectively) propaganda. To continue to divide. Its not working. Not for the majority. People listen please. They are lying to you. To push their naritive. If you actually listen to Trump. Not just the out of context sound bites they feed you. He and people who support him want unity more than anything else. For America. Then we can focus on everyone else. But we have a serious problem at home to deal with first. We have to let white, black, left, right and what ever else America go!! And realize we the people.
