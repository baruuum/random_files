Mexicans do need to be properly vetted and screened because they are coming from a country knee deep in political corruption and organized crime. This lying fraud is trying to get her voters to think Trump is racist and prejudice but fails to acknowledge the gallons of red blood leaking into mexican streets because GOVERNMENT DISARMED ALL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.
