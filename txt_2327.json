What do you think next week's excuse is going to be from the Dems as to explain Hillary's loss? Aliens? The cast from Duck Dynasty? My guess is that they will say Trump flew in the Aghori Monks, a modern day Monk Order from India that practices cannibalism, to scour the US and feed on Democratic Voters as to deter turnout.","commenter_a":"She lost because she is implicated in so many lies and scandals nobody has time for that.","post_message":"\"The Russians didn't elect Donald J.

You don't want to do any of the heavy lifting. There's no reciprocation on the part of feminists because they only care about themselves. Even if I did respond how you wanted, you wouldn't address any of my points and simply make ad hominem attacks. That's all you people are capable of because you have no critical thinking skills.","commenter_a":"To the men commenting on this post that are shaming other men for being feminists: shame on you. You are just proving the very reason why we, as males, have much to benefit from feminism as well","post_message":"The male activists all face roadblocks.
