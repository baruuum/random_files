For those precious children, for their mothers who have been fed lies from hell's own lips, and for those who would advocate for such heinous things to go on. I guarantee you this girl has had a couple of abortions and they were oh so wonderfully sickeningly sweet to her- so that they can use her face and influence. Makes me sick. Yes, she is responsible for her sins, but she's just a rebellious, gullible kid that several of these snakes have sunk their fangs into. Just like Brittany Spears before her- and Raven Symone.","commenter_a":"My heart went out to her when she started turning crazy. She's in the throes of rebellion, but I think it came because some of the snakes of Hollywood influenced her. She's rebelling against her dad, and the way he's tried to raise her, like many of the child actors and performers before her. The kid used to want to be a missionary and help save lives. Now she wants to be a champion for killing. I will still pray for her. God's arm is not short.","post_message":"\"I'm a good person to put on the face of a T-shirt.\""}]
