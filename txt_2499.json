Here in Brazil we already had our first woman president, and this brought to us hope about a better country, but now she is under impeachment process due responsibility crimes made and allowed by her.

Yet, that interaction, with all of its attendant suggestions & latent sexism & the very fact that it would not have happened without HER initiative, is somehow NOT her responsibility. That's the latently sexist, bullshit truth of femifucktardism & all of you self raping bleeding gashes. 90% of the time, anyway.
