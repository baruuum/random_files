Two people in love that want to get married would never choose someone to marry them that was not accepting of them. There are many other clergy accepting out there. Not all WANT religious rites. Civil ceremonies performed are the legal ones that count. Not one person (straight or gay) can get married in the church without that civil license first. People are getting totally out of hand on this. The church is going to do what they want anyway. What really counts is marriage is legal for all.","post_message":"Wow."},{"comment_id":"10153755876406337","commenter_b":"Fuck that hoe","commenter_a":"So I guess they're never ever ever getting back together","post_message":"IT'S OVER: Taylor Swift allegedly dumped Calvin Harris because of an, ahem, \"massage\"..."},{"comment_id":"809196999209345","commenter_b":"you are so full of it jeb - and you don't stand a chance. even insane republicans are done with the bushes. what's the policy on a presidential candidate's brother being a wanted war criminal????","commenter_a":"I am saying \"boo,\" not \"boo Jeb,\" though I AM booing Jeb.
