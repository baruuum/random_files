Lamarr (Hot Sauce) McDow was arrested Tuesday for violating the terms of his pre-trial release. As NewsOne reported last year, Marie Holmes, 26, posted bond for McDow three times — once just weeks after she collected her winnings ($3 million), once in August ($6 million) and again in October after he was arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon.

However it will never happen. That would mean doing what you're preaching and Hollywood is the least likely group to do that .
