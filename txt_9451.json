Many candidates talk about their support for fair treatment of women, and this amendment would provide a fundamental guarantee of equal rights.

Germany is expected to accept 800,000 refugees this year, while the US has accepted less than 1,000 thus far. Let's do a small part to encourage the U.S. government to be socially responsible. This is a humanitarian crisis and the Syrian refugees have nowhere to go.

A telling point, if in jest, that she made her own rules!","commenter_a":"Sorry, John. I usually love your stuff, but you missed the point on this one. As someone who used to have a government email account, this is a big deal. Every government employee must have one, and to access most government systems, you need to use it. This allows those emails to be captured as part of the public record. This is significant enough that it's caused me to reevaluate my support for her. I see two major issues: 1. I can't imagine the hurdles and hoops her staffers had to jump through to make this happen. And it wasn't like it made things easier for Hillary. Several high-ranking people I worked for had a government email account and hardly ever read it. Their staff checked their emails and passed on the ones they needed to know about (like just about any high-ranking person in a company).
