Real Feminists are not extremists seeking to belittle others. Liberal or conservative politics have nothing to do with that. Real Feminism exists on a daily basis through all walks of life. It incorporates normal women rising to challenges at work, at home, and in their communities, who expect equal treatment and equal compensation. It's sad that people can be so ignorant to this definition and can only judge radicalism with radical judgement.","post_message":"Long before feminism was a Hollywood buzzword, these films were way before their time."}]
