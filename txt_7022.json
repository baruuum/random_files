Here in Brazil we already had our first woman president, and this brought to us hope about a better country, but now she is under impeachment process due responsibility crimes made and allowed by her. This not means that women are worst than men, au contraire, I have been working with many managers, directors and executives women and found professionals better than men.

I know the tough talk is to \"just send them all back\" but those aren't plans. Sure wish yall had answers to problems instead of continuing this political theatre.","post_message":"Last night, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that effectively blocks President Obama's unilateral executive actions on immigration. The magnitude of the President's executive overreach on immigration cannot be ignored. The House passed legislation to stop the President's unlawful plan, but Senate Democrats will not even allow it to be debated. It is my sincere hope that Senate Democrats see this legal action as a wakeup call and let the House bill be considered in the Senate."},{"comment_id":"10153327649961943","commenter_b":"She should be in Prison As well as ALL the rest of that bunch!","commenter_a":"$170,000 is a really hefty pension for the shaft of Obammy's challengers by the crooks in he IRS .
