Almost 50 years later, his failed projects are STILL a cancer on the area. Take infinite seats. Google \"Discovery Bay, Pass Christian, Mississippi\". Take infinite seats",

    "commenter_a": "Corporatism perpetuates this slavery- it emerged at the dawning of the Emancipation to re-enslave Black Americans. Furthermore, free-trade destroys the remaining freedoms that Black Americans, the indigenous peoples of Western colonies, as well as other people from the middle and lower-classes currently enjoy ie, protective local labour laws, access to affordable medicines, religious freedom, etc. Corporatism breeds Communism. Corporatism and Communism are interdependent because you cannot separate economics from politics and religion (philosophically, this would include the religions of Atheism and Anti-Religion). Both systems are hell-bent on achieving world domination. Keep up the good fight Barbara Lee, with God's help we need to fight Corporatism and Communism with Democracy, Democracy-enabling Religions, and Democracy-upholding Capitalism. God bless you sister.
