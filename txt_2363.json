We need to let Russia have their way with Soros and rid the world of this vermin.","commenter_a":"Soros is behind the refugee flood into Europe. His organizations sent Syrian approx. 19,000 tweets promising them housing and jobs in Europe and telling them how to get around border guards. He also was behind the whole effort led by Hillary to overthrow Middle East governments and replace them with governments of his choice. His influence has cost the deaths of thousands and thousands of people in the Middle East. This is the face of evil.","post_message":"Hacked documents from George Sorosâ€™s Open Society Institute state that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully convinced the Obama administration into increasing the total number of refugees taken in by the U.S. from 70k to 100k per year."},{"comment_id":"1061695460512781","commenter_b":"Forget about the suicidal Muslims getting atomic bombs, let's get those guns WTF","commenter_a":"\"Sniper ammo\" is next...wait for it....","post_message":"We didn't say anything about gun control, but it is gun control.

Reagan granted amnesty in the 80's and it was to be a one time thing for those already here. Settled once and for all. But they keep coming. And this problem is not just from Hispanics although they make up the majority of inflow. If they couldn't come legally then they shouldn't be here. People have been coming legally for 100 years (like my father and his parents). No excuses. They are breaking the law and need to be deported.","commenter_a":"All he has is big ego","post_message":"Dude!
