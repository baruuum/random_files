It is the 9th Circuit that violated the Constitution under the Separation of Powers with its ruling. The fact is that President Trump clearly has the constitutional and statutory authority to issue this order. It is clear: radical Islamic terrorists are at war with America. President Trump order is a proper and constitutional way to protect America.
