We were sending her to a private school until fifth grade,and we enrolled her in the public schools instead. I believe she had somewhat less homework in the public schools but it still seemed a lot. Children definitely need time to be children and to be able to play, make friends,and have free time.","post_message":"American school kids are drowning in homework compared to other countries.

If we can't afford social programs to help the people of this country, how the fuck are we gonna pay for a war? Not a Bernie fan, but you can't trash one candidate because \"We can't afford him\" when Trump wants to cut shitloads of taxes, and THEN try to finance a mass deportation, a war, and then a wall. Don't even get me started on how prices will shoot up on produce, as well as anything illegal immigrants touch.","commenter_a":"Honestly Bernie Sanders not winning would make me lose complete hope for the US. They are being presented with one of the most honest, genuine, good hearted humans possible, yet they prefer to give the likes of Donald Drumpf and Hillary Cliton their attention.
