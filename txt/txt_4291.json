You can fix bad teeth and weight gain... You can't fix being that ugly on the inside.","post_message":"How can people say things like this?"},{"comment_id":"582726195242593","commenter_b":"Omg seems that all woman are becoming liars now ^ smh^ unbelievable","commenter_a":"There are two women Trump doesn't want to tangle with. Elizabeth Warren has forgotten more about economics than he ever knew. And Hillary's foreign policy knowledge is something he will never acquire. She will decimate him in a debate because he will have to be ready to speak on issues, not just make personal attacks. He is so thin skinned that he will self destruct as soon as she holds his feet to the fire. He and his followers don't have a clue. They have demonstrated time and again that when all else fails, thuggery rules. That doesn't win elections once reasonable people make up their minds not to put up with it any more. Now I just hope that reasonable people do that sooner than later. Put him out of his misery as quickly as possible.","post_message":"He's got a problem."},{"comment_id":"10155205853325354","commenter_b":"She is on the chunky side. Normal for someone that does little exercise, like most @username women.","commenter_a":"ummmm Thats what we call a plus size!!????

American problem vs not America's problem","commenter_a":"White Christians have committed more acts of terrorism in America than Muslims. Some of you are clearly stupid & misinformed","post_message":"It doesn't help that Trump has been \"fanning the flames\" with his anti-Muslim talk."},{"comment_id":"10155061325079575","commenter_b":"Why would he care about dapl? Obviously he has no intention of cleaning up the water issues in Flint, Michigan either. Because who cares about the people of this country and their wellbeing when you're Trump","commenter_a":"They dont want money it is about the water supply and the destruction of it!","post_message":"President Donald J. Trump signed executive actions to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. The projects had previously been blocked by the Obama administration due in part to environmental concerns."},{"comment_id":"923411781030392","commenter_b":"You can see intelligence in many statements and never know the color of the person saying it. If you are suprised when you find out, you need to examine what you find in yourself. Common sense ignores color.","commenter_a":"Why when I read this do I keep seeing the statement \"Black mother\" or \"Black woman\" this is the problem with racism in our country. Let's stop using the color of our skins in small comments like these. I feel like this 1 small step would be a huge step in a direction and future with less focus on skin color and more on humanity.","post_message":"Do you agree with Mom?"},{"comment_id":"659276420929603","commenter_b":"I guess she could go back to Africa Ebola does that ring a bell","commenter_a":"Dam she's got lips like monkey boy.I bet she could suck the crome off a trailer hitch.","post_message":"This entitled woman just demanded a free drink...
