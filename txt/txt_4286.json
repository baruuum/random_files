The only reason they gave back access is because a court battle over this would have revealed to the public that every democratic campaign had access to those records, and when the Sanders campaign reported it, nothing was done. Which would have highlighted not only the DNC favoritism of Clinton, but of the fact that they have been working to shut down Bernie at every turn. Which would have meant public acknowledgement of Bernie actually having a chance to win.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders sued, and the Democratic National Committee backed off, but it's not over yet."},{"comment_id":"10155973648509199","commenter_b":"This Woman is money smart.
