The USA is far better than this. Be bold, represent your district, and stand against the unconstitutional, corrupt administration that has taken office. The administration's actions should be leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work closely together and assert power as the legislative branch, rather than acting as an extension of the executive branch. #NoBanNoWall","commenter_a":"Congressman Reichert, I believe it is important to remember that the United States of America is a REPRESENTATIVE republic. As our elected REPRESENTATIVE, please REPRESENT the people of your District. You were elected to REPRESENT the people of the 8th Congressional District of the State of Washington (NOT Donald Trump).","post_message":"Careful vetting to ensure the safety of the American people is the responsibility of the federal government and one I take very seriously. Unfortunately what we saw this past weekend was mass confusion and miscommunication between government agencies and the improper apprehension of people legally allowed to be in the US. I urge the administration to work with Congress on solutions that protect our borders while maintaining our nation's dedication to compassion and religious freedom."},{"comment_id":"10153904097708984","commenter_b":"She's an American.

Instigators to anti-police sentiment? Comments like Paul's are simply deniers to the findings of two separate independent investigations that produced identical findings. That is, Brown never had his hands up, was never surrendering and he was the aggressor.","post_message":"The Justice Department has finally confirmed what many of us were certain was the case: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told the truth about what happened when he said he shot Michael Brown in self-defense. After a six-month investigation, the DOJ concluded that Brown, allegedly a thug and a thief, was not trying to peacefully surrender when the incident occurred. He did not hold his hands up and say, “Don’t shoot.” And he was not shot in the back, as some alleged. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153083416063984","commenter_b":"Stoopidbitch","commenter_a":"Doesn't it just make you proud?","post_message":"Obama will not meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he'll meet with these 3 YouTube sensations?
