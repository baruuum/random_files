The party comes first to Republicans.....the people and the country are not important until they can be used to the advantage of THE PARTY. Sad","commenter_a":"Honestly, I'm worried about 'merica if trump is such an overwhelming decision for them to make. Consider the members of the Republican party, they're going to vote trump because he's not a Democrat. That means, party alliance is more important to them then things like racism and ignorance.

Democrats can't play fair cause they know they are not going to win people are tired of being lied to and their rights being striped away...people this is a wake up call!!!! If you value your freedom you better dig deep in who your voting for...because all Democrats are trying to take our rights away!!!","post_message":"This is hilarious.
