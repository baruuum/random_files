What is perhaps even sadder, is that I am not surprised by the terrible comments. They are offering to do something kind and selfless.","post_message":"More than 11,000 Icelanders have offered to take Syrian refugees into their homes."},{"comment_id":"1495136007456674","commenter_b":"Just every woman with a family huh? Men with a family don't do more too?","commenter_a":"You all don't know what hard work is. Every woman that has a family does more than fast food workers, and fireman definitely do much more than fast food workers!!!","post_message":"\"Some people say paramedics don't even get $15 an hour and they save lives. So why should fast food workers get that?\" That question comes up a lot when we cover #FightFor15 rallies, like this one in Detroit.

Where I live people ask me often to remove my hair from the seat at the bus because is too long so I have to because my hair does not move by itself.

If you want to live some backwards, 1950s lifestyle, you go right ahead. While you're at it, why don't you just keep your opinions to yourself, since that's what a nice housewife would do, right? Give me a break. This misogynist refused to give her a break. There is also nothing to be modest about when it comes to breast feeding or pumping. Maybe you're the one who should work on modesty when you're over there over sexualizing a part of the female anatomy that is meant to help sustain life.","commenter_a":"She should have Left the room To Pump! Really Embarrassing for the female and males in a business Meeting! Have you no Modesty or even Selfrespect ! Stay home till your baby is weaned !!","post_message":"Donald J.
