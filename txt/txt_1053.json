I'm sure if Kim's paycheck was affected by how many licenses she issued then her religious beliefs would't be as important.","commenter_a":"Hey, wait a minute.....where's the outrage towards the Muslim bakeries (several) who refused service to gay couples planning weddings because of their religious beliefs? And why did the Muslim Target store cashier get an allowance to her job description to specify items she refused to ring up for a customer when they wanted to purchase a bottle of wine? And why did the Muslim flight attendant (<----surreal, isn't it?) get a religious liberty allowance to her job description by refusing to serve alcohol to a passenger? Yeah, okay. Had Kim been a Muslim, this narrative would have flipped to sympathize on the side of religious liberty. But she's not Muslim.

I wrapped her up, rocked her and kissed her and kept saying she would be ok, she was a good girl. It's hard to see them wake up scared and alone so as an assistant, we have to watch them while they're waking up, so why not keep them safe feeling and warm in your arms?","post_message":"Baby Meesha was coming out of surgery and was crying and scared.
