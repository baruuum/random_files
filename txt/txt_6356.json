They love to rape. That's it.","commenter_a":"Im still confused. Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. ðŸ˜•","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"10153409431986336","commenter_b":"Give it a rest ! Donald Trump has every right to his opinion. I agree that this country has had an influx of illegals for years. Be informed and know that Mexico and Guatemala have cut a deal to send thousands more to cross our borders illegally. The monies they send back to Mexico and Guatemala is $120 Billion dollars. This president wants to give them a free pass plus $35 thousand tax refunds? So they cross illegally, burden our health centers, schools, and oh only so you get my disgust! All I used to hear at the hospital is people telling other relatives of theirs to \"Come to the U.S., because this country is so stupid. They give you money for living, food stamps and oh if you have your babies in the U.S. , then they are citizens and you can stay\"... So these so called nice people ...","commenter_a":"Its a PR move.

While Congress enacts statutes, the courts write case law. So, let's put to rest the ERROR that courts don't make law. If you don't believe me, find me the statute in your state that defines the elements of slander. The decision in Obergefell doesn't require that you do anything, unless you are a marriage officiant, so I don't see how you can refuse to obey the decision.","commenter_a":"The Supreme Court \"ruling\" is NOT the Law!

Especially at the college level. Shouldn't they fear being shot in the head too? Thankfully we are getting guns on college campuses so that all authority can be radically challenged with an in your face confrontation. The Russian left has always known the power of confronting authority so I'm glad America is catching up. War and Revolution baby! Just like the founding fathers intended.","post_message":"This is beautiful."}]
