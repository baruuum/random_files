All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first.

Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."},{"comment_id":"10154589153096336","commenter_b":"The only place Hillary should be is in prison! #trump2016","commenter_a":"MAY HAVE???????","post_message":"Newly released emails suggest a senior Hillary Clinton aide stage-managed her first hearing on Benghazi by feeding specific topics to Democratic Senator Robert Menendez. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154885483751037","commenter_b":"Ugly nacty women","commenter_a":"Rachel Rauth","post_message":"Sen.
