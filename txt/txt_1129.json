Taxes are revenue for the government which are used for various expenses. When you balance the budget that means you are simply not paying down debt but spending less than you have. We need to start moving in a direction where we will run surpluses and thereby pay off previous debt. Just like a company, a government should not be run by debt. Now theoretically by increasing taxes = more revenue which could be used to pay off debts but that doesn't always work in modern society. We are a people who now are all run my debt, we own nothing anymore.","commenter_a":"Realistically the only way to reduce the deficit is increasing taxes. The problem is Hilary wants to increase to help her buddies and Bernie wants to increase taxes to add more social services.
