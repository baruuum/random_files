Nothing these crybabies should be kissing the cops asses for saving them lol","post_message":"What happens when whiny anti-Trump protesters interrupt The Few, The Proud, The Marines?"},{"comment_id":"10153855033026167","commenter_b":"Because no one said that embassy personnel had NEVER been killed. What had NEVER happened was that their murder was lied about to the victims families and to the public","commenter_a":"Holy moley, I 'm mad that I didn't DVR this. Bruce Levell got his A$$ handed to him on national television. If you support the bigotry, you're a BIGOT. It's pretty damned simple! He's gotta be reeling this morning, lol. #GoBlow!","post_message":"This is incredible. Charles Blow calls out Donald Trump's bigotry and everyone that is supporting it. ���"},{"comment_id":"10153212063865950","commenter_b":"U go girl.....GIRL POWER....kick that pussy ass thieves ass","commenter_a":"Wow. Go serena","post_message":"When Serena Williams saw a thief snatch her phone at a restaurant, she took matters into her own hands. Without thinking, she jumped up, leaped over a chair or two and chased the suspect down. She was on him in a flash."},{"comment_id":"1773091102960388","commenter_b":"FBI Director Comey states that \"There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton lied\".","commenter_a":"I'm not a Republican by any stretch of the imagination, but at least we can find some common ground on the Hillary Clinton issue. It's completely insane that the DNC has supported her this whole time. She, along with Bush and Cheney, need to be in jail. Let's stop allowing these people on both sides to be above the law.","post_message":"The Director of National Intelligence should deny Hillary Clinton access to classified information given how she so recklessly handled it as Secretary of State."},{"comment_id":"1256330341086427","commenter_b":"I recently read an article where he said he doesn't change diapers and taking care of the kids was his wives' responsibility, so I think it's fair to say he probably has zero understanding of fetal development and pregnancy. This is a man, after all, who called a breastfeeding woman disgusting for needing to pump breast milk. Fun fact-Donald Trump is not the only man who has no idea what he's talking about in this arena. I had a friend who had to explain to a coworker, who was a father of THREE children, that breastfeeding women need to pump at work because they cannot start and stop lactation at will. Guy thought a breastfeeding coworker could just wait until her 8 hour shift was done to start lactating, and was disgusted that she stored her breast milk in the fridge.","commenter_a":"As a C-Section baby myself, I was scratching my head for a good long while after he said that. I don't understand how a seventy-year-old man with five children (and a few grandkids!) could be *that* ignorant of childbirth!","post_message":"“It is, of course, such an absurd thing to say,” one doctor said. “I’m unaware of anyone that’s terminating a pregnancy a few days prior to delivery of a normal pregnancy.”"},{"comment_id":"10153581516273984","commenter_b":"The feds will just print more money huh. That's what's wrong with America is people like you don't know how things operate. The only money that gets printed is money that gets destroyed that banks send back. We are not in debt because we keep printing our own money. We can only print as much money as we have in our gold reserves. The reason we are in debt is because we keep borrowing money from places like China. But see that's the problem with the people in this country, they run to the polls to vote but have no clue how anything even operates","commenter_a":"Trump won't be any better. We will have more wars and more debt. Your pensions and other government ensured money will be gambled away again. The dollar will continue to devalue as the Fed prints money debt money. More American jobs will go overseas to China and Mexico. The middle class will slowly but surely wither away while people wonder what happened AGAIN and do absolutely nothing but complain on the couch or internet. The list goes on and on and on but you reap what you sew I guess. It is always the younger generation who has to clean up the mess of the old as always.","post_message":"Donald J. Trump just ripped apart Obama's Iran deal with 6 blunt words that hit home to millions of Americans. You know Obama hated hearing him say this, because Obama knows it's the truth."},{"comment_id":"10155263002346162","commenter_b":"we have a lyin' idiot Donald Duck, willing to bet with any one, end of this idiot presidency we will have recession, Trump will drive our bus thru cliff","commenter_a":"How can he block news orgs from a 'press' briefing?
