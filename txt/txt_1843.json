Fat people can't wear bathing suits? Pretty girls have to wear short skirts? No one... NO ONE has the right to decide what someone wears. Change laws to promote freedom. Let them choose. Don't choose for them. Clothing doesn't oppress any more than guns shoot people. People oppress. Change that.","commenter_a":"It oppresses women. Before everyone says it's s their religion, it was taught to them by a man. And yes all religions use other ways to oppress women that should stop as well.

It's a cultural problem endemic of Northern Africa, not Islam (Christians and Jews from this region have the same problems with this practice).","commenter_a":"Yeah, except this ancient religion doesn't through gays off buildings, mutilate female sexual organs, and and want to kill anyone who doesn't become a Jedi!

Reagan granted amnesty in the 80's and it was to be a one time thing for those already here. Settled once and for all. But they keep coming. And this problem is not just from Hispanics although they make up the majority of inflow. If they couldn't come legally then they shouldn't be here. People have been coming legally for 100 years (like my father and his parents). No excuses.
