You're idea would only hurt the citizens of those cities. I agree that the federal funding needs to get cut for processing illegals, but lack of tourism would be cutting jobs, and hours for legal, working citizens that have nothing to do with it. Trust me, the working people in \"sanctuary cities\" want them gone, too.","commenter_a":"Not only should these cities lose their federal dollars, but people should not visit these cities and they will also lose their tourism dollars. Maybe they will cooperate then!","post_message":"One of Donald Trump’s most popular campaign promises was to end “sanctuary cities,” where local officials refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies on deportations.  This refusal to enforce the law makes these cities magnets for criminal illegal immigrants seeking to evade arrest and deportation and puts their citizens at grave risk (like Kate Steinle, the young woman allegedly shot to death in front of her family in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who would have been in custody if local authorities hadn’t released him from jail instead of turning him over to the feds as the law required.)    Trump isn’t even in office, and already, some city leaders are having the same kind of tantrum we’re seeing from protesters in their streets.  The Democratic mayors of Chicago, New York and Los Angeles all defiantly declared that they’ll never give up their “sanctuary” policies and cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  L.A. police chief Charlie Beck also announced that his force will never work with Homeland Security to deport criminal illegal immigrants.  He said, “That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.”   Memo to these mayors and to the L.A. police chief:  As law enforcement officers, your job is enforcing laws, not protecting criminals.  If it takes cutting off your federal funds to force you to do your jobs and put your citizens’ safety first, then maybe that should be the very first cost-cutting measure President Trump takes to reduce the deficit."},{"comment_id":"10153034720411130","commenter_b":"Biggest problem, IMO,is the black daddies who make kids then disappears.The moms are just as bad with 5 kids and 5 different Fathers.","commenter_a":"All lives matter, saying only one race matters is why there is much violence going on.
