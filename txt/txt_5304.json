It dates back to at best sometime in the late 70s/early 80s. I remember a girl in my youth group had brought one of her Mormon friends one summer's eve, and I got into a conversation with her and I'll remember what she said til the day I die- \"I'm not a Christian, I'm a Mormon!\" That would have been 74 or 75.

From what I've read of the interview the journalist only wanted to talk about the problems of the muslims and presumably that was not what Aung Suu Kyi was expecting since no one had bothered to tell her that the main topic of the interview would by the persecution of the muslim minority. No politician likes to go into an interview unprepared.","post_message":"According to the man who revealed it"}]
