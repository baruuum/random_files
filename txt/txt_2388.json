A genetically male transgender would (quite correctly) not be allowed to compete in a woman's race whereas a genetically female transgender would only get beaten were she to compete in a male race. Caster is (it seems) totally different. If an intersex she has two X chromosomes that would normally make a female but, unlike true females she also possesses male Y chromosomes that will give some male characteristics. If she has Y chromosomes then she isn't qualified to compete in female races but, as with female transgenders, there is little point in her trying (and she should not with two X chromosomes) to compete in male races.","post_message":"South African runner Caster Semenya dominated the women's 800-meter final Saturday in Rio, finishing well ahead of the competition to take home the gold medal.
