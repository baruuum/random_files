Look who got 60% of the third largest state (NY) and watch where he is in the primary's tonight.","commenter_a":"For me, I hope Trump supporters realize he is only getting about 37-39 % of Republican votes on the average. I'm not talking about the one national poll that has him at 50%, I'm talking about the current raw, known facts, of these primaries.
