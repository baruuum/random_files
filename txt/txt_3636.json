Evolutionary dating methods are not infallible science, are based on certain built-in assumptions, and have been proven to be contradictory and inconsistent. Please read my popular Internet article, ARE FOSSILS REALLY MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD? There a lot of evidence that the fossil layers were not deposited by gradual floods, which would have required millions of years. Rather, the evidence strongly points to a one world-wide flood that fossilized species, just as the Bible teaches. The fossil layers in the real world are not even found in the sequence taught in evolutionary textbooks. There are many places where fossils of complex creatures are found beneath simpler ones, and there are fossils of mixed species existing in the same stratum which classic evolutionary textbooks teach should have been separated by millions of years. There is absolutely no proof of macro-evolution in the fossil record. ...","post_message":"BREAKING"},{"comment_id":"10154437348239087","commenter_b":"Crooked swamp dwellers.

Just for fun? Because they are some sort of sexual deviant? For all of you who say women should be women and men should be men because that's what God created...he created us all as individuals with our own thoughts and feelings - and yes, he even created those who feel trapped in the wrong body. Respect people for who they are, not where they came from, or who they become. Discrimination disgusts me.","post_message":"Yep, this pretty much says it all."}]
