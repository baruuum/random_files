This would apply to the House, state governors, all the way through to mayors and local city counsels are all controlled by big money politics.

It's a weird denial-fetish.","post_message":"\"We need third parties in this country. And by that I don't mean another third party supported by billionaires, that centrist, you know, in the sort of Ross Perot manner. I mean parties that represent different opinions on the spectrum in the manner of the populist party in the 1890s which was really the last time we saw a third party movement, that contested the ballot from the bottom all the way to the top and they were a real political party.   Unfortunately the techniques that the populists used are against the law in most states. If we were to repeal those laws you might have a vibrant third party scene again.\" - Thomas Frank, author of the new book \"Listen Liberal\" in a 2012 conversation with Bill Moyers."},{"comment_id":"1736127839964656","commenter_b":"Maybe she should be mad at the powers to be who wanted it kept quiet.","commenter_a":"Maybe tptb should have done thing differently but since it all came out kelly has been a spoiled hateful spiteful bitch.

If these people don't want to be put into ituations like this they should dress in such a way as not to bring question upon themselves.
