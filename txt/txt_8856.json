She is not for the American people. Benghazi was enough for me to say #nohillary her plans to continue Obamacare, my vote is a NO, setting up a private server in her home where classified information on an unsecured server putting OUR safety at risk (then lying about it) that's a No. Claims she will fight for the children out of one side of her mouth and supporting late term abortion out of the other. #notwithher. The Clinton foundation taking donations from countries that abuse their woman and children, yet she believes in equality for women?? No way , never ever Hillary. Donald J. Trump for POTUS!!!","post_message":"\"She’s going to open the borders, pack the Supreme Court and you are not going to have the same country. Maybe you like that, maybe you don’t. But we’re not going back to the status quo, period. And so Republicans need to understand if Trump loses, it is a new America, OK? A lot is on the line, whether you like him or not.

Unlike Obama, Trump has control of congress and can appoint to the Supreme court due to the opening. Obama never had that amount of power. Plus Obama was a moron. Trump needs to build that wall. Trump needs to build camps and round up all illegals that can be found. Put them in internment camps till they can be removed to their country of origin. Or just put them in prison like he said for 5 years if they come in the country illegally. We have our president now like the minorities had Obama.","commenter_a":"It is not Van Jones' job to correct people to take away their fears. It is the Trump camp's job to do so. Don't tell people when to feel afraid and when not. You have to make them feel safe and welcome. Donald Trump is the President now. Now he has to do his job for ALL.","post_message":"\"You need to back off.\" CNN's Van Jones exchanged hot words with a Donald J.
