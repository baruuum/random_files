He is being treated badly!"},{"comment_id":"1665697853729274","commenter_b":"@username How do you know Obama didn't do half the stuff he's accused of? I say he did and another half we haven't heard of yet! There isn't going to be a recount of every state, but if there was Trump probably would win by a landslide. Hillary has done nothing but lose ground!","commenter_a":"I think you guys are forgetting this is a FREE country and people don't have to perform for someone they don't respect. He hasn't earned any respect and indeed, he has done quite the opposite. Insulting people left and right and you guys just cheered. Trump believes people should bow to him and perform for him. He is NOT a king. It is his own people that were crying that no one wanted to come and all of a sudden he wants \"just the people\" Please...don't make me laugh! He is already claiming he helped keep jobs here and claiming success for Obama's successes. He has already been caught in outright lies about it. Oh I saved Sprint, they are coming back...no, that deal had nothing to do with Trump. It's laughable! Why do you ignore it? Is it too uncomfortable for you people to acknowledge he has lied to ...","post_message":"They turned up their nose at our future president."},{"comment_id":"862806877145701","commenter_b":"Well said @username well said. America was built on the backs of immigrants, the indigenous people were treated and still to this day treated worst than the Buffalo. I hear them cry about migrants coming across the border, when they themselves have no right to the land they call home.","commenter_a":"History will judge him to be one of the best presidents we have had. I hope in the near future we will be able to have another such president.","post_message":"We DEFINITELY have Pres. Obama's back. Do YOU?  Thanks to Roy Mark Ramdas and Being Liberal."},{"comment_id":"685166964976590","commenter_b":"Donald Trump is what the definition of corrupt is. She won popular votes. He wont build a wall! He wont deport all illegals and he wont make america great by killing obamacare for millions of people. Your beyond stupid if you think you'll get anything from selfish republicans.","commenter_a":"Should have seen this coming since the day she barley beat Bernie even with all her corruption and everything in her favorðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚","post_message":"Hillary Clinton's advice to young people: \"Never stop believing that fighting for what is right is worth it.\""},{"comment_id":"10154153789003010","commenter_b":"Gee, I bet General Petraeus wishes people held him to the same standard they hold Clinton.

We shouldn't punish an innocent baby because of the sins of the father. I mean how many of us would be here if we were punished for the sins of our mothers and fathers?? Murdering your baby doesn't make you any less raped. My opinion is the morning after pill should be available with every rape kit.","post_message":"What the hell is wrong with this woman?"}]
