We are NOT voting for Hillary Clinton. The DNC should have let the election alone. You won't hear about it in the media or see it in the polls but MANY Democrats are pissed off at their party for rigging the election for Mrs. Clinton. I hear what's going on from the ground floor in the Democratic Party and from my calculations close to 30% of Democrats are not voting for her nationwide....

Wouldn't saying \"He can't do that\" because of the brand name be like saying girls can't play Gameboy because it has 'boy' in the name?
