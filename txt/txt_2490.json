There is a big number of registered democrats (like myself) for Donald J. Trump. So all democrats and independents (forget the republicans) supporting Trump, are that? That is how cheat this woman is. If elected, she will do the same to any ethnic group rejecting her, and will blow up one country after another, starting with Russia. Deplorable, is Hillary Clinton for expressing herself that way about the 75% of US citizens.
