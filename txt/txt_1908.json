Today, for the first time ever, the government arrested a Christian woman for living according to her faith. This is wrong. This is not America.  I stand with Kim Davis. Unequivocally. I stand with every American that the Obama Administration is trying to force to choose between honoring his or her faith or complying with a lawless court decision.  In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts rightly observed that the Court’s marriage decision has nothing to do with the Constitution. Justice Scalia observed that the Court’s decision was so contrary to law that state and local officials would choose to defy it.  For every politician — Democrat and Republican — who is tut-tutting that Davis must resign, they are defending a hypocritical standard. Where is the call for the mayor of San Francisco to resign for creating a sanctuary city — resulting in the murder of American citizens by criminal illegal aliens welcomed by his lawlessness?  Where is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws, our welfare reform laws, and even his own Obamacare?  When the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.  Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office. That is the consequence of their position. Or, if Christians do serve in public office, they must disregard their religious faith–or be sent to jail.  Kim Davis should not be in jail. We are a country founded on Judeo-Christian values, founded by those fleeing religious oppression and seeking a land where we could worship God and live according to our faith, without being imprisoned for doing so.  I call upon every Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis. Stop the persecution now."},{"comment_id":"10154937686570329","commenter_b":"They must belong to one sexy mother fucker","commenter_a":"Those are some sexy thighs","post_message":"END OF STORY."},{"comment_id":"1590050817948698","commenter_b":"Hey, Justine.

I lost a job due to not having a sitter while their father was in jail. Little did I know, 2 people who used to come into my old employment owned a small family bar and needed help. They contacted me and offered me a job. I had only been there for a short time and my boss lent me money to get my boyfriend out of jail. After a month when I reached the end of this relationship my boss lent me his car and more money to get a place and get on my feet. He never took the money I owed him out of my check. He told me to pay when I could. Every year for 3 ...","post_message":"What's the kindest thing that someone has ever done for you? Tell us in the comments below.
