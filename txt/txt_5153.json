You are still avoiding what you are going to do with the illegals that aren't criminals. Actually they did break the law if they came here illegally and if they stay here even if they don't get citizenship it's still ammnesty. You need to be up front with what you are going to do.","commenter_a":"Great speech!!!!","post_message":"Thank you for your wonderful support last night- with regard to my Immigration Speech that I delivered at the Phoenix Convention Center.
