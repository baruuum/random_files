She said that a while ago. First, tell that to Gloria Steinem, honey. Second, I think it's not really feminism when one woman decides to deride another because she decides that she's not doing it right? Yeah, no. Sorry. That sucks a lot.","commenter_a":"Stfu demi","post_message":"'How the fuck am I making this about myself?' â€“ Demi Lovato"},{"comment_id":"10153182951850950","commenter_b":"Oh, just stop with the outrage already. African countries sell these permits for more than the price of the average house in the USA, and only allow hunters to take the old males that have already reproduced.

Nothing is impossible, if we want to do it. If we can dig tunnels below, we can build walls above.","commenter_a":"It doesn't sound like trump at all. That's most probably what trump should have said. Everything bill Clinton said has been implemented. He doesn't mention deporting 12 million people (impossible to execute), he doesn't mention building a wall (idiotic and impossible to execute)... So no, doesn't sound like trump at all. This sounds like someone that actually has a executable plan, unlike trump. Not to mention calling a whole nation rapists, murders and drug dealers.","post_message":"Do you think this sounds a lot like Donald J. Trump?
