We stare into each other's eyes and I ask him about his family and living on the street and all his circumstance and history. I call him a bunch of names to see his reaction, Blackie, Shadow, Coal, Midnight. Larry hates that 'his name is Clyde, you're confusing him.' I'm also proud to wear a tshirt that says 'all I want to do is drink wine and rescue dogs' and it has a real red wine stain on the front!","post_message":"This comic shows a dog's heartwarming journey from the shelter to his forever home."},{"comment_id":"10153569563806051","commenter_b":"They should be sent back where they came from ASAP !!! End of that story !!!","commenter_a":"Please do some research. What does your state actually offer in the way of public assistance to noncitizens? In California noncitizens are not eligible to cash assistance or Calfresh (foodstamps). No Social Security or Medicare without legal residency. So just what are you haters talking about? I hope none of you ever find yourselves in a financial situation which would drive you away from your home in order to survive. I hope you don't call yourself 'Christians' because you are so far from the core of that belief.","post_message":"Should illegal immigrants be banned from receiving Obamacare subsidies?

We can't be picking and choosing what a man can talk about. What? Are we going to ban cops from discussing baseball?
