They're not surprised, it's actually common. I wish I would have called sooner than suffer unnecessarily.","commenter_a":"I've had 6 c-sections.. 3 of which were After a long labor. While laughing and/or coughing is painful for the 1st day, that's about the worst of it, I never took pain meds after... The first one I might call 'rough'- but the other 5 were not bad at all. #5 was 6 weeks early and I had to pump milk and walk to the nursery (she needed the heat light) every 2 hours to feed her, it really wasn't that bad.","post_message":"Congratulations!

It is a proven fact that people who will torture and kill animals have no qualms in \"upgrading\" to humans.

They patrolled by cops. An if did know this after 9/11 the FBI and NAS already monitor communication it those communities than to the Patriot Act. So what Ted Cruz is talk is already being done. What Ted Cruz really wants to do like communist leaders would do in term of monitor arrest you and in prison you with any form of guilt. He want to doing like Castro. It's funny Ted Cruz father escaped Cuba to get away from communism. No Ted Cruz is advocating the same communist view his father escaped from. If you look at his policies Ted Cruz is nothing more than a communist pretending to be a Republican.","post_message":"Ted Cruz was blasted this week for saying Muslim neighborhoods should face extra patrolling to prevent extremism.
