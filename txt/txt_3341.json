You are well spoken, but you are not a happy person obviously. Not one smile! Mostly grimace. As to your subject matter-good for the blows to Hilliary and putting Christie in his place. But your arrogant head bobbing when talking about meeting foreign leaders etc. is just overboard. You better get on board with Trump, only the media and establishment hate him and are tryin their best to convince audience that he is hated. VOTERS want him!!! Voters love him!!!","post_message":"Putin won't listen to more talk. We need to show him there's strength, leadership, and courage on the other side.
