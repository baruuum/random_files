Because as an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, Sanders, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the \"Trump Strong\" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Strong Again!

This sir, is what you stand for and represent.","commenter_a":"I can't believe he found a woman stupid enough to marry and procreate with him.","post_message":"Janet and I want to affirm our support for the Duggar family.  Joshâ€™s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself, 'inexcusable,' but that doesnâ€™t mean 'unforgivable.'  He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities.  No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story.  Good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things.  The reason that the law protects disclosure of many actions on the part of a minor is that the society has traditionally understood something that todayâ€™s blood-thirsty media does not understandâ€”that being a minor means that one's judgement is not mature.  No one needs to defend Joshâ€™s actions as a teenager, but the fact that he confessed his sins to those he harmed, sought help, and has gone forward to live a responsible and circumspect life as an adult is testament to his familyâ€™s authenticity and humility.  Those who have enjoyed revealing this long ago sins in order to discredit the Duggar family have actually revealed their own insensitive bloodthirst, for there was no consideration of the fact that the victims wanted this to be left in the past and ultimately a judge had the information on file destroyedâ€”not to protect Josh, but the innocent victims.  Janet and I love Jim Bob and Michelle and their entire family.  They are no more perfect a family than any family, but their Christian witness is not marred in our eyes because following Christ is not a declaration of our perfection, but of HIS perfection.  It is precisely because we are all sinners that we need His grace and His forgiveness.  We have been blessed to receive Godâ€™s love and we would do no less than to extend our love and support for our friends.  In fact, it is such times as this, when real friends show up and stand up.  Today, Janet and I want to show up and stand up for our friends.  Let others run from them.  We will run to them with our support."},{"comment_id":"1800961159929656","commenter_b":"This is not the true Ekklesia of Christ!

The bible says beware of wolves in sheep clothing it also says we are in this world but not of it. We true Christians are to be aware of these wolves and Not join in the sin with them but we are to pray that God will remove the scales from there eyes and pierce there heart so they can see and repent of what is so wrong that they think is right.may God have mercy on these people","post_message":""}]
