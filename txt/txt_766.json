In 1990, there were 1.6 million abortions performed. Today, it's a little over a million. Numbers don't lie. 2. Hundreds of thousands of women were getting abortions BEFORE Roe V Wade legalized them. You are more likely to die due to childbirth/pregnancy complications than an abortion. 3. You are contributing to your own problem. Teens that had received comprehensive sex ed were 60% LESS LIKELY to get pregnant. The states with abstinence only education have HIGHER rates of teen pregnancy compared to states that actually teach sex ed. Why do women get abortions? Unwanted pregnancy.

Just don't want you to let what is beyond any our control override the richness of all you have in your life. Isn't it amazing how much we reveal about ourselves in little vignettes of our lives. Called sharing, and all of us as your Facebook friends enjoy your posts very much.","commenter_a":"Judge Pirro comments were so articulate, to the point, and crystal clear honest evaluation of exactly what has happened to our wonderful country in the last eight years. I remember so clearly Michelle's remarks at 44 years of age saying it was the first time she had been proud to be an American, I was shocked beyond words! To accept so much as we are given as Americans and not to be thankful and proud of our country and our fellow everyday wonderful citizens, Americans! Color or religion are immaterial, Americans and I for one am so thankful for being one and never fail to appreciate what it is to be American. Thank you Judge Pirro for your concise evaluation of Michelle Obama.","post_message":"In the final days before the Obamas leave the White House, Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro just gave Michelle a parting gift she'll NEVER forget."},{"comment_id":"10152739973466519","commenter_b":"The Democrats are the snakes.
