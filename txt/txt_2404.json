The DNC has chosen Hillary Clinton to be their next presidential nominee, and is doing whatever it takes to silence the voice of the people. We cease to be a Democracy when the Party receives millions in funding from the same media corporations that report biased coverage in an attempt to deceive voters. We cease to be a Democracy when the Party takes deliberate actions to suppress voter turnout, turns away registered voters, and commits election fraud in Arizona and across the country. We cease to be a Democracy when the Party selects super delegates (many of which are Lobbyists) who refuse to the listen to voice of the people the are intended to represent.
