Also that according to court documents, that her ex was terrified of Amber after the \"assault\" took place and that there was property that belonged to the ex that was damaged. Funny how records show one thing and now the ex is stating something different.","commenter_a":"Why isn't @username publishing the story Daily Mail and TMZ did about Amber Heard's domestic violence charge from her ex \"wife\". She obviously has a violent past and I'm not say that \"if\" she was abused that what happened to her was justified. The fact maybe they had a volatile relationship. She could have also beat on him as well as he her, again abuse is abuse. But for all the victims out there, if she is lying for the money that's basically a slap to the face for those who were actually abused.","post_message":"iO Wright says Amber Heard suffered at the hands of Johnny Depp."},{"comment_id":"563771597144022","commenter_b":"Stfu","commenter_a":"Why the Attacks on Gary Johnson, are you Afriad he's going to take it, from crocked Hillary ? I like some of his Policies, his open boarder policy is why I am not voting for him. but A vote for him is a vote for Him, and you saying he doesn't know any Foreign leaders, this is the same guy who climbed Mt.

Their feelings are hurt so they will be boycotting Beyonce by not doing their job. We need to make sure to send enough panties for them to wear so they can cry comfortably at the boycott.

This is a sad day in America when our police officers are crying and boycotting for hurt feelings.","post_message":"Usher, Demi Lovato, Yolanda Adams and The Band Perry are among the contemporary artists heading to The White House to celebrate the late Ray Charles."},{"comment_id":"10154894095826509","commenter_b":"Good doctor.

She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didn’t care – as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.  Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.  As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.  What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history."}]
