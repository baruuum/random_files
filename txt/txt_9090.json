What they did to this country is almost irreparable damage, it's overwhelming, and the amount of people they killed is staggering. You NEVER read about an American killing a Mexican. But you do read the opposite. You can't take the illegal out of an illegal. They will always be a dark cloud of problems to any society they get it. They can't change, they're programmed that way. They will bring virus' disease and plunder. Even the ones running their country a derelicts of the 3rd kind, their intent is to make America part of Mexico, that's why they send them, that's why they don't assimilate and want YOU- (Americans to assimilate) ...(google \"The RECONQUISTA / Mexicans say they will take America without firing a single shot\")..this is why Vinente Fox and Jorge Ramos are trying ...","commenter_a":"The role of our government is to keep its citizens safe.....sadly they are failing \"A house with no walls will collapse\"","post_message":"‚ÄúThis is something that‚Äôs happening almost on a daily basis now, that we have illegal immigrant criminals that are committing murder or rape or numerous child predator type actions.‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Ronnebeck"},{"comment_id":"10156735133795354","commenter_b":"Yes, but they do not work, they are LAZY","commenter_a":"That would cost more too , plus how many on welfare due to injury taking pain medicine gonna be positive anyway ?

I feel that they should have been deported long ago and not allowed to come back into the US since they came in illegally in the first place and those that have done this they should never also be allowed to try for Citizenship to The United States...","post_message":"Donald Trump just showed everyone how much illegals really cost. Enough is enough. Send them all back! Do you agree all illegals should be deported?"}]
