She will wind up moving up at her job to the highest position, paying more taxes, and bettering her life. People around her will be better from her life. She will put out better quality in everything she does or touches. It can all start with positivity here and with acknowledging that this Woman is money smart.","commenter_a":"Those berating the mom...it is her employer who is getting the \"subsidy\" by being able to make more profits by paying wages families cannot live on - of course they also can sell things for less, so consumers pay less, so they benefit. Wondering where she lives that that's a years rent, where I live that's a couple of months. Messed up system, but glad for her fam.","post_message":"\"Instead of buying my kids the latest Jordans or fancy electronics, I paid my rent for the YEAR.

Donald Trump- another great White Hope! Trump joins a long list of rich entitled white boys who, were it not for their daddies, handing them everything on a silver platter, would have probably ended up on public assistance. Trump represents everything that is wrong with America. He is a gaudy bully and fake gold plated braggart who has showcased his business and moral acumen through a unending series of bankruptcies and divorces. He is a racist grifter and a criminal environmental rapist. In terms of patriotism and service to country, Bush, Romney, Cheney, Trump did not serve this country that they profess to love. But none of these fake ass patriots apparently have any qualms about sending other American children into harms way. For this crowd of \"real Americans\" it's all about the Benjamins and what's in it for me.

What she poured into this election was ill gotten money. She sure didn't use her own. I Honestly feel her major Dissapointment is her self absorbed issues that would have only added more money to the Clintons Fraudulent Foundation . Being a Great Nation is now much more attainable without corrupt Killary and the rest of her lackeys.","commenter_a":"Wow. So much hate on these posts. I hear a lot of people upset about the protests going after she lost but it seems like there are just as many sore winners out there. Whether you like her or not, people need to learn some respect. I guarantee 99.9% of the people on here haven't the foggiest idea what it takes to hold a high ranking position in our government or run for president. She poured a lot of time and effort into her campaign and to still come up short must be a major disappointment. I'm sure a lot of people have done less and been more hurt by their own failures. I thought this was a country of conscience and good will. This election has proved we are much further from being a great nation than we claim.","post_message":"â€œI know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves if America is the country we thought it was.\""}]
