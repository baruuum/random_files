They didnt have to shoot her.have you noticed all the killings for petty crimes like selling cigerettes, stealing a pk of cigerettes. Being homeless, even jaywalking or talking back to police. This is not a good situation. Real criminals who rape and torture getting away with it because the police would rather arrest or kill someome who is not a threat.
