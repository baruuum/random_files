The woman just has to walk around with the evidence. So many are so quick to hold up signs and protest against a woman's choice yet we have so many unwanted children waiting to be adopted. Caring for children doesn't stop at a fetus. If you're going to protest and shame a woman for making, for some a very difficult choice, how about you go through an adoption process, pay for children's education and medical, etc. If you're not out there trying to adopt unwanted children, then you really shouldn't be shaming a woman for having an abortion or taking her right to choose. Perhaps if people and the government put this much attention toward education, and giving equal opportunities to all, we would have more successful people and less unplanned pregnancies.","post_message":"\"Women's health and rights are now one of the first casualties of the Trump administration.\""},{"comment_id":"10153635074276336","commenter_b":"Christina you are made of stupid.
