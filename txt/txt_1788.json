The number ending up at Calais is miniscule, the article also states most don't even know about our benefit system so maybe we left behind a massive impression after colonising half the world they figure we are the country they admire or can relate to, to be honest i don't care, if its they live or die then they should live here","commenter_a":"Those people in calais are not true refugees or asylum seekers, if they where, they would claim fir asylum in france. EU law says that they should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Last time I checked, france is a safe country, so is spain, italy, germany, and many other eu countries. What I don't understand is why there are over 5,000 of these so called asylum seekers camping in calais trying to get into the uk. If you are a genuine asylum seeker, you don't get to pick and choose where you want to live.","post_message":"When you’re facing the world’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, it helps to have a sober debate about how to respond. But to do that, you need facts and data – two things that the British migration debate has lacked this summer.  These, in the clearest terms, are the 10 key facts."},{"comment_id":"10153146887251955","commenter_b":"She is ugly like hell!!","commenter_a":"Hair fell out because nothing in her head to attach to","post_message":"Bald first lady?

Muslim Imam just said it in Press conference (is like we did it n so what) is just mass shooting Hello THIS IS TERRORIS AT ITS BEST ISIS STILE, wait our Muslim President blame gun control","commenter_a":"IF he really wants to stop shootings he should go to Iraq or Afghanistan .where shootings hangings, stoning, acid baths, beheadings, gas weapons, all take place on the regular. WE have been saying this is going to be a problem here. we already have too many whack a do 's to deal with, and letting people who have an intense hate for a certain segment of our society in to this country with NO understanding of our population and LAWS other than it picks up the tab, is a recipe for this very thing. But IS NOT a good enough reason to give up my gun rights. I will just cling to my weapon and bible thank you very much. gay people everywhere should understand this now, weather it's a gun or a bomb, you are on their hit list.","post_message":"Speechless."}]
