You don't see that those women keep on having babies that they can't take care of and are sold into prostitution. Oh, but im wrong for believing in controlling the problem.

Or maybe idk use some self control & abstain from sex altogether? They are consenting adult women fully aware of the possible outcome/consequences of their choices.
