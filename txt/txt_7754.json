Veterans treated shamefully especially the wounded in our VA hospitals. THe amount of our money that has been given to terrorist countries that hate us. And the flooding of our country with illegals who are given everything when we have many poor who could use help. Plus we do not know who or what has been coming here.

Jail should only be for Killers, Rapists, and Burglars. Is that too much to ask?","commenter_a":"I see, so break the law, claim you're poor, and get away with breaking the law. Talk about \"privilege\". :/ Being poor is NOT a \"justification\" for not taking responsibility for one's own acts. No more than being rich is a \"justification\" for not being responsible for one's own acts. It's interesting how people complain that the rich aren't being held responsible for committing violations of the law, then claiming that the poor should NOT be held responsible. Rich person doesn't pay their taxes, they belong in jail. Poor person doesn't pay for legal fines and fees, they should just be entirely excused for breaking the law. Interesting.","post_message":"Kevin Thompson was jailed for five days because he couldn't afford to pay fines and fees from a traffic ticket.

Uneducated people who have no idea about current events would have no idea. With the whole Confederate \"battle\" flag all employees probably got a notice with its picture on it saying why Walmart wants nothing to do with it. Common sense people. Also total set up to prove a point that we choose at the moment what we're going to have a hissy fit about and how worse things could totally go under the radar because of the uneducated and ignorant people out there.
