All 3 of these women have helped over the years to set Americans back 30-40 years. They are simply useless Politicians!! I agree with @username, Diane Fierstein and everyone who voted in favor of her proposed bill should be thrown out of office for violating their Oath of Office. This Bill had it passed would have been in violation of the 2nd and 5th Ammendments, and to attempt to pass such a law is clearly a failure to \"protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Enough of this Liberal Politically Correct BS. Time for change and Hillary and Bernie clearly are not the answer.","commenter_a":"Time to vote the senile out of office or just plain remove them!!
