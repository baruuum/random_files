Like honestly, if you wanna take cum and get pregnant maybe you should think before just doing","commenter_a":"If you have kids you deserve the struggle. Don't have kids until you feel ready or accomplished enough to bring a new life into the world. If you have kids before the age of 21 then you are a complete idiot and shouldn't get help from anyone cause stupidity isn't worth saving","post_message":"Great point!"},{"comment_id":"10152972266751051","commenter_b":"No, phuck you, Eric!

Some women don't want to have kids at a particular time. Some never want to have kids. Second, most women who have abortions do so because of financial reasons. Third, contraception isn't 100% effective. Some types are only 75% or so effective. The diaphragm in a multi-para woman has a low effectiveness rate. I've been pregnant twice on oral contraception. Each woman has her own story. If she wants to tell it, she will. Otherwise, it's none of your damned business. Oh, and if my body is affected, it is my choice. I have self-autonomy over my body.","commenter_a":"Abortion is not a method to avoid pregnancy; a woman can avoid pregnancy by using birth control provided to her for free and not getting herself pregnant. Abortion is, in reality, simply a way to avoid MOTHERHOOD; it's not 'my body, my choice,' it's 'my LIFESTYLE, my choice.'","post_message":"The question matters: More people support abortion rights when the poll language focuses on women. #LetsTalk @webpagelink"}]
