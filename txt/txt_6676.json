A person who was there for most of their presidency and knows them better than just about anyone has listed a few corrections. Bill says: \"In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\" The facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal. Bill says: \"Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.\" The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the ...","post_message":"Hoy, el Departamento del Trabajo acaba de anunciar nuevas reglas laborales que garantizarán el pago de horas extras a trabajadores que ganan hasta $913 dólares a la semana o $47,476 al año. Esto es más del doble que el límite pasado de $455 a la semana. Hillary: \"Aplaudo al presidente Obama y al Secretario del Trabajo, Pérez, por estas reglas sobre horas extras laborales, las cuales levantarán a trabajadores a nivel nacional y ayudará a que los salarios aumenten nuevamente para las familias trabajadoras. Durante el primer año de la implementación de estas reglas, millones de trabajadores adicionales serán elegibles para el pago de horas extras, finalmente cobrando totalmente por las horas que le dedican a sus trabajos... Nadie que trabaje 40 horas a la semana debería tener que mantener una familia en la pobreza”."},{"comment_id":"10154232027346491","commenter_b":"Tom....amen","commenter_a":"PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA...EVEN THOUGH obama DIVIDED MORE THAN ANY SITTING PRESIDENT...

The woman just has to walk around with the evidence. So many are so quick to hold up signs and protest against a woman's choice yet we have so many unwanted children waiting to be adopted. Caring for children doesn't stop at a fetus. If you're going to protest and shame a woman for making, for some a very difficult choice, how about you go through an adoption process, pay for children's education and medical, etc. If you're not out there trying to adopt unwanted children, then you really shouldn't be shaming a woman for having an abortion or taking her right to choose. Perhaps if people and the government put this much attention toward education, and giving equal opportunities to all, we would have more successful people and less unplanned pregnancies.","post_message":"\"Women's health and rights are now one of the first casualties of the Trump administration.\""},{"comment_id":"10153432953951130","commenter_b":"Its not hard at all.

That was it for me. Iran has already violated the 5 year ban on developing and testing ballistic missiles which was part of the nuclear deal and guess what - do nothing Obama is just ignoring it. As far as national security goes - Obama is a disaster. And now he wants to bring in 10,000 refugees from ISIS territory who can not be vetted. Obama is not good for America or Israel.","commenter_a":"CORRECTION: It is under Obama that Israel has received more defense material than under any other previous administration! And these people have the gall to call him the worst President for Israel! And with His Highness' present standing in international diplomatic circles, his voice is hardly more than a \"whisper\" in the globalized wind! It's about time that people become aware of what he has wrought on Israel's reputation.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10155205853325354","commenter_b":"She is on the chunky side.
