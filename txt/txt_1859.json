The USA is far better than this. Be bold, represent your district, and stand against the unconstitutional, corrupt administration that has taken office. The administration's actions should be leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work closely together and assert power as the legislative branch, rather than acting as an extension of the executive branch. #NoBanNoWall","commenter_a":"Congressman Reichert, I believe it is important to remember that the United States of America is a REPRESENTATIVE republic. As our elected REPRESENTATIVE, please REPRESENT the people of your District. You were elected to REPRESENT the people of the 8th Congressional District of the State of Washington (NOT Donald Trump).","post_message":"Careful vetting to ensure the safety of the American people is the responsibility of the federal government and one I take very seriously. Unfortunately what we saw this past weekend was mass confusion and miscommunication between government agencies and the improper apprehension of people legally allowed to be in the US.

Perkins and Kelly also discussed the Islamic State’s ultimatum, as well as their torching of an 1800-year-old church and destruction of one of the oldest communities of Christians in existence. “That’s the choice of freedom under Islam,” Perkins said. “This administration has been silent continuously when Christians have been persecuted,” he continued. “[It] is more concerned about offending Islamic states and Islamic nations than they are of defending the long standing policy that America has always had — that religious freedom is a human right, not just an American right.”","post_message":"“We will find the people who did this.
