Maybe you can sensationalize more Halloween hoarder homes while you're at it. I am glad Nickcole Dykema didn't actually hurt any Deputies (and she most likely could have, ambushing them in her own home like that), and glad the Deputies didn't kill her. This is a lesson for Police dealing w/ the mentally ill everywhere. I do hope this woman gets access to proper mental healthcare, and that through treatment she can find her way back into the world with peace and dignity.","post_message":"Multiple deputies received injuries at the \"house of horrors\"   From removing weapons from the \"booby trapped\" home"},{"comment_id":"1648860662067713","commenter_b":"Why doesn't that useless cunt step in front a speeding train??","commenter_a":"Rosie O'Donnell is against guns, but it's ok for her body guard to carry one to protect her!!!
