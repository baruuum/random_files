Nor hens. It's better than being an omnivore, yes, but still not cruelty free. Although nothing truly is. From medical treatments, medicine, to our pets sustenance, to palm oil, to beauty and household products, etc. As for diet, we are naturally omnivorous. We would not have survived very well as a species without meat as sustenance and the remainder for clothing/tools, along with plants, fruits, nuts, etc. Especially in the North.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10155049282976729","commenter_b":"She is totally delusional","commenter_a":"Anyone else notice that everything killary is guilty of, she and her supporters blame on Trump? She smashes cell phones with a hammer, but Trump has a bad temper? She will raise taxes on the middle class, but people say Trump will? He never said that, yet people say he will.

Liberalism is a disease, a mental one.","post_message":"You definitely won't see this on the mainstream media..."}]
