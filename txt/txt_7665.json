[{"comment_id":"10152888732626680","commenter_b":"This recent ruling by the Supreme Court on gay marriage is only about civil unions. Those who are making this about church unions could not be more wrong as the Majority Opinion of Justice Kennedy points out: \"Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered.","commenter_a":"Here come the lawsuits from the States!","post_message":"The Supreme Court has legalized gay marriage nationwide by ruling that the U.S. Constitution bars states from denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Full story: @webpagelink The landmark, 5-4 decision split the court along the usual ideological lines, with Republican appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court’s liberal wing to back same-sex marriage rights and the court’s remaining GOP appointees dissenting. Before the court acted Friday, 37 states authorized marriages by same-sex couples, but most of those states did so due to court rulings that could have been overturned if the Supreme Court reached the opposite result."},{"comment_id":"1170595402996226","commenter_b":"And the world would be a lot better place without your racist, misogynistic ass in it.

Chose a president because she is woman is sexism. Here in Brazil we already had our first woman president, and this brought to us hope about a better country, but now she is under impeachment process due responsibility crimes made and allowed by her.
