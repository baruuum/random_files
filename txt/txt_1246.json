Like The Walking Dead was supposed to make my BRAIN EXPLODE, and Game of Thrones was supposed to make my BRAIN EXPLODE, and Dr. Who was supposed to make my BRAIN EXPLODE...Seriously, how much did Raimi and Co. pay you guys to headline Ash vs. Evil Dead as an exploding-brain event? Because, you know what? Every time @username claims some stupid TV show will \"explode your brain,\" viewers barely end up with a BRAIN TWINGE. So instead of over-hyped praise, why don't you guys try something different? Something along the lines of: \"WE SAT THROUGH THE FIRST EPISODE OF ASH VS. EVIL DEAD AND WE DIDN'T GET CRAMPS IN OUR ASS.\" In short, Lower Expectations = More Pleasurable Viewing Experience. You're welcome!","post_message":"Ash vs Evil Dead is going to make your brain explode in the best way"},{"comment_id":"1116798981710579","commenter_b":"She's feeding her baby. Shut the fuck up and move on","commenter_a":"Well it isn't racey,it's natural. This is ridiculous people need to approve of the way babies were intended to eat and get over it.

Blanket misconceptions are counterproductive, especially when it comes to school. Much like the Pledge crap that goes around... we do the Pledge, even if Fox news says otherwise.","commenter_a":"When my children are sick, they'll miss school. When they have dentist appts they'll miss school. If I decide it, they'll miss school. I'm the parent, our family's needs come before school administration's needs. Period. The school is LUCKY to havey children attend and i warch them like a hawk. Our childrens mental health is more important than grades and standardized testing!! And @username you've got to be high on meth if you think for one minute every doorstep wants or needs a social worker or, the GOVERNMENT rather, invading their privacy, trying to make parenting decisions or stomping on civil liberties on even the smallest scale. I wouldn't put up with that for a second. And haven't you been paying attention to what a total, corrupt failure DHS is anyway??? Ridiculous notions.","post_message":"Oregon schools have done little to intervene despite having 94,000 students miss at least 10 percent of the school year."},{"comment_id":"10154689577603812","commenter_b":"He also has many lawsuits in the 80's and 90's for discrimination against blacks and people of color.","commenter_a":"TRUMP STOOD UP FOR BLACKS AND JEWS: About 20 years ago the rich elites ran Palm Beach and wouldn allow Jews and blacks to use the golf and country club facilities.

Caroline Torr This horse was in a field when a Chinese lantern landed on top of the horse's blanket and set the horse on fire! Chinese lantern may look amazing when let off but do you know where yours lands after you have seen it fly away??? What do u think happens to the wire frame of the lantern? The ban of Chinese lanterns needs to happen and can't come fast enough for me!!","post_message":"Should there be exceptions to Canton's sky lantern ban?"}]
