What kind of people are we to sit back and let the government ruin our lives. You saw, as Americans, how much power we have when Megyn Kelly attacked Donald J. Trump. Why aren't we furious about ISIS and demanded our government eliminate them all. obama has done an excellent job on turning American people against one another an will continue to do so as long as WE allow it.
