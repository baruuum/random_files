I've witnessed coyotes stalking my dogs while they're in the back yard, and I can't have barn cats because the coyotes kill them. The coyotes get closer and closer to my house every chance they get. I'm all for nature taking its course, but you can guarantee I'm going to protect my pets' lives over the life of a coyote. How do you know this coyote didn't just attack a farmers chickens or livestock? How are you so sure this guy executed this specific coyote for the sake of its fur? I don't think you are. Posting graphic videos for awareness is one thing, but posting a graphic video with the wrong facts is nothing but propaganda.","post_message":"WARNING: EXTREMELY HARD TO WATCH.
