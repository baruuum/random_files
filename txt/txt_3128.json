That mother is a monster!","commenter_a":"I don't know that it's child abuse, so much as poor parenting. Different religions physically discipline their children, pursuant to their faith - there's a line where it become child abuse, but I don't know that that threshold has been met. As to the poor parenting - yeah, she really should not have done this. Humiliation of a child is not ever going to be the correct form of discipline. And, it will likely result in later life issues. This is a private matter, which should have remained in the home. If the girl had friends, then they should have been told in private, not through a public shaming. And I would hope the mother focuses less on the letter grade and more on the actual learning. If your child thinks that \"allowed\" and \"aloud\" are the same thing - your problem is bigger than you realize.","post_message":"A mother is facing child abuse charges after she sent her daughter to middle school wearing a \"public shaming\" t-shirt for getting \"F's in all of [her] classes.\""},{"comment_id":"10153392413471748","commenter_b":"Abortion is safe cause ha aint getting in","commenter_a":"Historically, once extremism takes hold, it is very, VERY difficult to put the genie back into the bottle. As long as the extremists face no serious consequences, they will just get more and more radical in their pronouncements and actions. Only when there is a very strong backlash is there any chance of them backing down, as we saw when the anti-communist witch hunts were finally contained. But religious extremism like Huckabee's is much harder to deal with (as Goldwater presciently saw), because they regard all resistance as persecution and attacks by spiritual enemies. Sadly there is a chance, even if it is small at the moment, that America will ride the tiger of extremism to disaster. And unlike Germany after WW2, there would be unlikely to be any second chances, any opportunity for redemption, because a radical, apocalyptic, theocratic USA would almost certainly initiate WW3.","post_message":"Mike Huckabee thinks that as president, he could prevent literally all abortion."}]
