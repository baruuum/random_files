These ARE troubling times. I can't believe they think the American people are that stupid. Enough is enough. Stop with the violence and let us now hear what the Clinton camp thought should be deleted. (Despite the State Dept. request for ALL email on server) I think at the end of the day people of all colors and beliefs in America will find they thought we were all stupid enough for them to screw all of us.

I get them all the time on my business phone and my unlisted home phone. Especially Google. They are one of the worst.","commenter_a":"You let them know not to call you again usually by hitting 3 but it doesn't matter as they'll call you again using another number. Most are spoofed numbers. I had my own phone number come up on Caller ID one time! there is a site that you can check out numbers, www.800notes.com to let others know about the callers but the telemarketers don't care about that site. I see a lot of people on there saying to 'Stop calling me!' yet don't leave their number. Yes, I'm tired of the 'Lower Your Credit Card Interest' or letting me know about a topical pain ointment.

Callers also try to tell you that your computer has issues and that they are from 'Windows', not Microsoft.
