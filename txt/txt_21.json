I'm pretty sure they were taken there and didn't voluntarily have themselves incarcerated. Don't say it's impossible. That said, I think it's improbable and impractical to plan on finding 12 million illegal immigrants as a whole and deport them. Just let them remain illegal and deport them as you find them. Let them stand in line with everybody else who is attempting to immigrate LEGALLY.","commenter_a":"I think lots of them will self deport. Especially those who are gang members and have been deported and came back illegally. Cut off benefits and the free loaders will leave.

Compared to Clinton he looks honorable, compared to Sanders he looks responsible. Since those two are the media darlings, those are the only two he needs to be compared to until he can get out of single digit polls. If any of those candidates expect to get moderate Independent and Republican voters next fall, they need Webb on the ticketâ€¦ unless Trump manages to stay in the race.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders defends his record on guns after Hillary Clinton pounces. #DemDebate"},{"comment_id":"10153137487806336","commenter_b":"Because 'not topless' she would never make the cover.
