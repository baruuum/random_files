All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first. When you take children from their homes, good or bad homes, put them in counseling. Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."},{"comment_id":"10153659904056770","commenter_b":"PEOPLE GUESS WHAT SHE WORKS FOR HILLARY NOW...","commenter_a":"Interesting Demcratic take on LGBT, since it's rumored that Hilary herself might fall into this category!","post_message":"Recently leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee revealed staffers had some less than LGBT-friendly comments."},{"comment_id":"894715537301698","commenter_b":"The best thing you are doing, Mr. Trump, is weeding the un-Americans out from our society.
