But they also learn about the dangers of smoking and drinking at age 13 (give or take a year) in mandatory health class yet can't smoke or drink till 18(now 21) and 21? The logic is just weird.","commenter_a":"Why is it that we don't let people smoke till 18 and drink till 21(both of which mainly affect their own health) yet we trust teenagers as young as 15 and a half to drive a vehicle with the potential to kill others? Seems a little backwards doesn't it? Saving people from themselves but not saving them from others.","post_message":"The smoking age in California is now 21. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1201199053280181","commenter_b":"For them girls that gotta get from one dick to the next real quickðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚","commenter_a":"Rebecca oh lawwwd noðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚","post_message":" "},{"comment_id":"10153862268256680","commenter_b":"@username I was waiting for Hillary to pass out again and need to get dragged off stage.
