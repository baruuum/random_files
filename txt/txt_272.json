I had my daughter's ears pierced when she was an infant and she felt the pain for 30 seconds. She was completely calm and pain free afterwards. Her ears healed in less than a week bc of how fast her body grew at that time. She had less risk of infection then (she was too young to play w her ears) and less healing time. I, on the other hand, had mine pierced at 6 and ended up with problems bc I took them out when I shouldn't have..","post_message":"“Severe pain and fear is inflicted upon infants unnecessarily,” the petition states.

Civilians kill cops and either get killed by other killer cops, or if very lucky, they get arrested, charged, and sentenced. Killer cops have no empathy for civilians they kill, or their families. The copsuckers show no empathy for the victims of killer cops who again, get away with it. If the killer cops, along with their apologists don't show empathy for the victims of police killings, why should civilians show empathy for the killed cops? If the killer cops won't shed tears when civilians get killed by cops, why should civilians shed tears when cops get killed? If the killer cops along with their apologists think it's OK for the civilians to be killed by cops (the unjustified killings), why shouldn't the civilians think it's OK for the cops to be killed?
