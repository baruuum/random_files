With all apologies to John Stamos, there are a lot of critics out there that simply have no mercy for this nostalgic reboot (okay, that was a really bad pun). Fuller House picks up 21 years after Full House, which left television screens in 1995 after eight seasons on ABC. This time around, DJ (Candace Cameron Bure) takes the Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) role as sheâ€™s... @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153268288138984","commenter_b":"Asshole !","commenter_a":"I bet if the truth were known, he didn't get injured by some machine falling on him.

I know I haven't stopped crying since Thursday and I never met the man or knew him other than his movies and music. He was a beautiful soul and will be truly missed. @username take things so out of context it's unreal and always have to make things a issue where they should be no issue. Prince was a sexy, talented, giving man and I know I am devistated and I am a fan that will truly miss him.","commenter_a":"Prince was an amazing human being for so many reasons, but really??? 1) Comparing his, or any singular death, to 9/11 is crazy! 2) Why is this a race issue? It's like saying that only us Minnesotans are truly grieving.","post_message":"Dave Chappelle once impersonated Prince for a now-infamous Chappelle's Show skit."},{"comment_id":"498451153654689","commenter_b":"This is one more reason we need you","commenter_a":"I want to vote for you.

Which is sexist af. But he wants his daughter to be an Ivanna, so ... also hypocritical. Should women be successful in business or not, according to Trump? Are successful woman attractive to men like Trump. Read the article, it's not made up.","commenter_a":"Such an interesting article Christine Johnson!!!
