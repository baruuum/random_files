Poverty, desperation, lack of global perspective, dread and hopelessness all dim the people's hope. Terrible place to live. For an uplifting story about this neighborhood check out HONY's series on Ms Lopez and her school there. So much work to be done, sadly the people who live there are the most marginalized people in NYC. Short of starting over, not sure what will happen to the poor in that city in the way it's going. These are the extreme sides of the coin of gentrification.","post_message":"The woman, 18, was walking with her father when 5 men approached them."},{"comment_id":"10154385949804087","commenter_b":"@username I think he ran away like a little bitch","commenter_a":"If all you ding-bat liberals would have acted like mature adults, all the EXTRA security wouldn't be needed and costs would have been much less.
