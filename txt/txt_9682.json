Hillary Clinton's contributions to American society as a woman are many, but the overall theme of her efforts is that she has continued to stay involved in the great issues of her time, despite setbacks and criticism of her actions. Throughout her life, she has been a strong advocate for women, children and families. In 1988 and 1991 she was listed as one of the 100 most influential Lawyers in America by the National Law Journal.

I simply illustrate that women must figure out exactly what it is they want before complaining about how things are. I purposely let the door close on a woman because I don't always hold it for a guy. Women give me a stink face so often and I tell them it's me treating them equally. Have a woman pay for her own dinner once and see how far you get to having a second date. ... List goes on and on","commenter_a":"I've been to the Middle East. There isn't an American woman alive that can talk to me about oppression by men. Women run this country. They are the reason men wake up in the morning. I feel women in this country have an identity crisis in that they want chilvary but in the same instance they want equality. Men are tough and ravenous towards each other. You want that then don't complain when men treat you as they would a fellow man. (I want to add this doesn't apply to ALL women just the ones it does)","post_message":"Much of what we hear about the plight of American women is false."}]
