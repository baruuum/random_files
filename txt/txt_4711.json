There isn't going to be a recount of every state, but if there was Trump probably would win by a landslide. Hillary has done nothing but lose ground!","commenter_a":"I think you guys are forgetting this is a FREE country and people don't have to perform for someone they don't respect. He hasn't earned any respect and indeed, he has done quite the opposite. Insulting people left and right and you guys just cheered. Trump believes people should bow to him and perform for him. He is NOT a king. It is his own people that were crying that no one wanted to come and all of a sudden he wants \"just the people\" Please...don't make me laugh! He is already claiming he helped keep jobs here and claiming success for Obama's successes. He has already been caught in outright lies about it. Oh I saved Sprint, they are coming back...no, that deal had nothing to do with Trump. It's laughable! Why do you ignore it? Is it too uncomfortable for you people to acknowledge he has lied to ...","post_message":"They turned up their nose at our future president."},{"comment_id":"1235851089812062","commenter_b":"You're as ghetto as this chick","commenter_a":"I had my daughter at 16. I hid my pregnancy til the day i had her. My family just thought I was getting real heavy. Yes it was scary I was way too young and I knew my life would change. I had to grow up and do things most 16 yr olds don't have to. But i loved my daughter and can't imagine a life without her. I will never understand this! At 16 you know better!!! Give that child to a hospital, family someone!","post_message":"A infant girl died after being thrown from a second-floor window, allegedly by her 16-year-old mother after the teen gave birth.

Just think how our country would change!","post_message":"You can see why this lady was one heck of a prosecutor before becoming a judge. If only she could get Hillary into a courtroom.  Do you support the way Judge Jeanine is fearless in her truth-telling?"},{"comment_id":"1644783155547189","commenter_b":"Not busted, she's been padding HER wallet for a L-O-N-G time!

I said \"meaningful\" and, I'm hardly \"bent out of shape\". Does this effect me personally? Not really. But, it does effect my community/state/culture...whatever you want to call it. A day to celebrate pot? It's laughable to most. You can think I'm ignorant all you want, I still think it's ridiculous. Again, my opinion. Not sure why you feel the need to argue with me.","commenter_a":"Go to work. Volunteer. Do something meaningful. Beyond ridiculous.","post_message":"Denver's 4/20 rally has been rescheduled."}]
