She refused. An officer was called since a teacher cannot physically remove a student from a classroom. The officer asked her to come with him, she refused and pushed him. She had then assaulted a police officer. Which is an arrest-able offense. She then resists arrest while further assaulting the officer (hitting him). Why does anyone think this is ok? These children have no respect for authority. I see most people defending her. Seriously?","post_message":"This guy can bench press 605 pounds, and he threw that tiny girl across the room. And the one they arrest is the girl who was brave enough to stand up to him."},{"comment_id":"10153105510381336","commenter_b":"I elected Obama twice. You wingnuts act like Hillary did some sinister dastardly deed that caused 4 people to die at Benghazi.Not true..The US lies and spies and tortures and misleads as a matter of policy.J ust like Bush Rumsfeld and Cheney did. I will never vote for a conservative. Politic is a tough business. acvtually governing is something the GOP has forgotten about.","commenter_a":"What truly amazes me is that State Communications Security let her first use a personal e-mail for government business and second they let her keep an unsecured server at her home. This is a complete violation of all government communications security regulations and practices. There is no way possible that she did not send classified e-mails during her entire tenure as Secretary of State and there is no way possible that they can say that unsecured server was not hacked by outside sources. What kind of a moron would think that? The idiots that are defending this woman are absolutely CLUELESS as to the magnitude that this Security Breach is. People go to jail and/or get fired for much less than this. It is absolutely mind boggling and staggering to me that this server was not turned over and now has supposedly been wiped. This server should be confiscated and ...","post_message":"Rep.
