Nobody, adult or child or fetus, is entitled to use someone else's body parts without their permission, EVER. If you have kidney disease you don't get to take someone else's kidney by force - not even if your life depends on it and you'll die painfully if you don't get it. If you have leukemia and need bone marrow, you cannot take it from someone else without their consent - even though marrow is fully replaceable by a healthy adult and it'd only be a temporary inconvenience to them. Men can't use a woman's genitals for their own pleasure unless she consents - that's why rape is (supposedly) a crime (even though punishment for it has been tragically lax these days). A woman's uterus is HER body part, she has it ...","commenter_a":"It's just a political witch hunt, like usual.
