Both candidates are far from perfect but I'm going with the one who doesn't support the butchering of full-term babies, who doesn't support millions of immigrants being granted citizenship, who is in favor of term limits and ending special interest groups in DC, who will create jobs through trade reform rather than the government creating yet another program and who will reform the health care system and end Obamacare, which, in case you haven't checked, your policy is going up by 25% next year, who supports our military and vets and our police officers and supports the NRA and my second amendment rights and the list goes on and on. If the truth were ever told by the media, this would be no contest.","post_message":"Federal agencies are barred by law from endorsing candidates in political elections"},{"comment_id":"519010834890623","commenter_b":"This article was July 2013","commenter_a":"That's story has been out for years - when is he actually gonna do it?","post_message":"Actor Johnny Depp wants to purchase the historical landmark Wounded Knee and gift it back to the Native American people."},{"comment_id":"10155189089842439","commenter_b":"Please believe...that they are AT WAR with the rest of the non-islamic planet!!!

The religious faith of Muslims includes belief in Allah as the only god, (deity) and in Muhammad his prophet. And if anyone does not believe in Allah, they must be killed as infidels (non-believers)! Their goal and ideology world wide since the inception of Islam in 700 AD is to convert the world to Islam or kill them as non- believers! Notice what's been happening worldwide the past eight years? The Quran is their teaching book ALL Muslims learn from and live by daily. It makes up 99% of who they are and how they live.
