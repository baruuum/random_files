So your way off on \"over 500 years\" more like 200 years. And the majority of this country was built by Irish and Chinese labor not black. How come for hundreds of years Irish were slaves, yet Irish people don't use it as a crutch and a complaint of why they can't do something. 6 million Jews killed in the holocaust, that was from 1933-1945 that was roughly 1350 a day for 12 years. Yet Jewish people don't use it as a crutch and a complaint why they can't do something. Neither one of these groups were given nearly as much entitlement as the black community.... Yet the black community still complains that it's not enough that they can't get ahead. And yes most people look at black on black crime and ...","commenter_a":"What pisses me off is people that deflect this issue with Black on Black violence. Like y'all don't know that we just got rights in this country 50 years ago and the subsequent aftermath of white supremacy for over 500 years is the reason we live in impoverished areas with the shittiest schools. Y'all DO know that those circumstances breed violence right? Don't act like White men have not committed the most violent atrocities in this country since it's inception. Don't act like your \"discovery\" of America wasn't simply genocide. Don't act like multiple billion dollar industries that people still reap the benefits of today and in the future weren't built on free labor that black people don't see a penny of. Read sometimes. You will know why the black community has violence. Still to this day the most heinous crimes and serial murders are committed by white men.

People should take a look at Ted Cruzs resume and determine who is the presidential one. It is the most Impressive I hAve ever seen. He is a man of integrity with a brilliant mind. No skeletons in his closet. He is a true conservative who lives by the constitution. That is why he battles in Washington because he lives by what is correct. Look at all the cases he has won. He doesn't fit the mold of Harry Reid and company. He bucks them all the time. America needs him now and if we let him Slip by it will be our loss. There is absolutely no one running that can fill his shoes plus he is a born again Christian and he will restore our religious beliefs back to the country and constitutional rights","post_message":"Bill O'Reilly met with candidates right after last night's debate, and there was one thing Trump said to him that immediately caught people's attention...
