In the 90s, the extreme right-wing Republikaner and the DVU gained in support because of this blind open-door policy. What is more, Germany expects other EU countries to do the same, irrespective of the cost. I say that this has to stop.","commenter_a":"The Germans typically let in loads of war refugees. More than they can handle. It's their way of apologising for World Wars 1 and 2. In the 90s, they let in 320,000 war refugees from Yugoslavia. What happened in German towns ? Property rents skyrocketed and the crime rates went right up. What's worse, the Germans expect every other country to do the same. Whacky open-door immigration. The UK needs to leave the EU, get sovereignty over its borders and immigration / refugee legisation back and tackle the problem as a single nation. This time, the Germans are letting in 800,000 war refugees from Syria. Absolutely crazy.","post_message":"Ever since Angela Merkel took the lead on the migrant crisis, critics began speaking as though she created it.

'no deport them all' and stuff. and yet they forget who really made America. found by immigrants. the Irish had a very hard life back then, the hate saying this word, African Americans had a harsh life, people whats the difference between illegal immigrants and legal immigrants. a legal immigrant can be much more dangerous than an illegal. look what happen in 9/11. Boston bombing. ect. and how is it that an illegal can have a job, without knowing the English language. no American education?? the come here, and still believe that the American dream is still alivem but we Americans are the ones that destroyed it.","commenter_a":"THAT'S the way! No one is 'illegal'. We are ALL human beings and should treat one another accordingly.","post_message":"'We need to take 11 million undocumented people out of the shadows, out of fear, and we need to provide them with legal protection,' Sanders said."}]
