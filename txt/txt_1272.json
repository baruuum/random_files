Needs to grow up, cover up, and act like a lady!","commenter_a":"Fortunately the majority of police officers are good, hard working people serving/protecting their communities. Are there a few bad ones? Of course! The media really hypes the bad police officers, the knuckle heads looting and destroying communities 'in protest'. Not highlight the wonderful police officers laying their life on the line to protect our butts. Not highlighting the people that truly feel stepped on and are peacefully coming together with all to promote positive changes. 'Be the change that you wish to see in this this world.' This is what I live by and teach my children. We should be brought together by love, not torn apart by hate.","post_message":"#EntertainmentNews  And the #BoycottBeyonce battle continues...the singer is being accused of using her recent Super Bowl performance 'to divide Americans by promoting the Black Panthers and her antipolice message.'

We know by looking at her past experience and seeing it limited to special interest. She has almost no relevant experience. Cabinet members are to be experts in their field, not solely a wealthy donor to republicans. This is not a try out situation. There is not a revote. Your assessment of Trump's hiring practices ignore what we've seen even during his campaign. He had to find new campaign managers three times.","commenter_a":"Who in his right mind would approve of her, doesn't matter if you come from the left or right, everyone can see she is unfit for the job","post_message":"Senators are expected to vote Tuesday on the nomination of Betsy DeVos for education secretary.
