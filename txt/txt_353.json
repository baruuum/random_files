If one is a diabetic the whole world does not need to eat a diabetic diet. If one has a limb removed does the whole world remove a limb? Honestly I see no difference. We all have differences and we learn to deal with them, not expect others to suffer or deal with it.","post_message":"Watch this amazing video as the mother of a \"trans\" teen makes the most outrageous claim possible about North Carolina's new HB2 law.

Next stop the White House!","post_message":"This team is the only thing left that can stop Donald Trump.
