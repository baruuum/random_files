Where I grew up the \"N\" word was used frequently. Every time I was called that I retaliated. Im not a thug or a criminal. The teacher has to respect the students and vice versa. In hindsight the student should have went to the principal and then to his parents. Im in no way condoning what the student did but its a 2 way street. Dont bash the student when we dont know exactly what rhe teacher said. Racial slurs or any other forms of racism has no place in society. My kids or the kids I coach cant even say anything like that. Either way whatever was said isn't the problem. It was the lack of respect from the teacher and STUDENT.","commenter_a":"@username you say teachers need to watch what they say. I don't get it.
