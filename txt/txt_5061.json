You my friend are the dumb ass. He is a Muslim,educated in Jakarta,Indonesia at several Mosques. Born in Kenya and outer by several family members as being a \"Kenyan\" your support of this foreign born usurper of the presidency is ridiculous.

Our troublemaker-in-chief is keeping this going, stirring up strife so he can cry Marshal Law & keep his seat in our White House. We're in big trouble folks but most people don't even know that. Keepin' on puter & cell phone games, partying, gettin' high & working 2 jobs just to keep the bills paid. The average person has no time to protest & make trouble but we have the government paying people to not work so THEY have lots of time. It's how barry wants it to be.","commenter_a":"Loretta, Sadly, you're an intricate part of the problem.

It is unfair to say that we need to re evaluate our values because we want some one who can beat her. In the end America as a whole is not voting evangelical prudence and wisdom would say pick any one who can beat her. My one and only comment. Blessings sister...","commenter_a":"Christians who support Trump need to reevaluate their values. I've never heard of Christians supporting a strip club owner who defends Planned Parenthood and doesn't care about marriage, but that's just me. Oh yeah, and swears continually!","post_message":"Editors' Note: The Christian Post has not taken a position on a political candidate before today.
