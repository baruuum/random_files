They are illegal they have already committed a crime breaking our law.","commenter_a":"These left-wing liberals keep saying illegals should not be asked about their immigration papers, or lack of, because then they won't bear witness against criminals. HeII, they don't anyway! The last thing illegals are interested in is going into a Court of Law! These people will suffer in silence before testifying against one of their own. It's time for a change. In Europe, everybody has a PassPort or legit I.D. And cops and soldiers can stop you at any time. You produce that I.D. or you go to jail. Simple.

It is becoming more and more common in foreign countries to drug and even use ether to sedate people so they can rob them. I find the guy suspicious that said when he saw in the AM that their door was as he had left it he became worried. How did he leave it...closed like every other hotel room door? It's not like housekeeping found them. This guy called mgmt and they went in.
