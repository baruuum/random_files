Use your resources to unite the Democrats and fight this atrocity! Fight for what is right, just, Truly American.","post_message":"As a child, I witnessed the refugee crisis borne out of people fleeing the Khmer Rouge and Pathet Lao in Southeast Asia with my own eyes. I’m proud that our nation acted during that crisis to take in refugees, but I remain motivated by the knowledge that we could have done much, much more. The Statue of Liberty isn’t engraved with do not enter signs, it is proudly emblazoned with ‘give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.’ This is a quintessential American value and though we’ve not always lived up to our ideals, the President would do well to remember that we cannot afford to turn our backs on them, especially today—Holocaust Remembrance Day.   We are a nation that leads with strength—a nation that knows ‘the only thing we have to fear is fear itself’—not a nation that cowers in fear when faced with difficult choices. The America that I know is not one that slams its doors on families and children fleeing barbarism and terror, but one that shines brightly as a beacon of hope for all human beings. Giving in to our fears, as the President has done, is not the action of a strong country. Today’s order will ultimately serve to weaken our own national security, playing into our enemy’s hands and helping convince another generation of young people simply seeking safety that America is at war with them."},{"comment_id":"1258505287549557","commenter_b":"Nah yo Grandma shouldn't have been hoeing around on Christmas eve.

I'm an American. A REALISTIC AMERICAN!!!!! I agree with the person that mentioned the abuse of the welfare system, but those are Americans doing that. Illegal immigrants can't get benefits!!! To the person who said that the companies are putting money in their pockets I agree, but as soon as they have to pay minimum wage and provide benefits and go legit the cost will be passed onto the consumer it always does. To the person that mentioned Hispanic, Mexican etc. I never mentioned any group of people I made a general comment about all immigrants. You just showed how stupid you are that just because I mentioned working in Orange fields you automatically stereotype I was talking about Spanish people. Here's a little info for you not only Spanish ...","commenter_a":"This country was built by immigrants both legal and illegal. Im tired of hearing people complain about illegal immigrants!!! Who the hell do you think are working the lowest paying jobs that without them this country would not function. Will any of you go clean toilets for 6 dollars an hour (that's if they can get that much). NO!!! Would any of you go to the orange fields and go pick oranges for hours in over 98 plus degree weather for pennies a bag. HELL NO!!! But you like when you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for orange juice. If there were to be no illegal immigrants the costs of a lot of things people enjoy would sky rocket because the company would have to pay out more for employees passing the increase on to the consumer!!!!!! Everyone needs to back off immigrants because unless your ...","post_message":"There have been many to come out against Trump after his comments on illegal immigration, but one beloved politician just did exactly the opposite.
