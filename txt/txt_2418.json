So-called common wisdom has it that they don't want them because they're potential troublemakers. Your idea makes more (and scarier) sense.","commenter_a":"I don know if anyone realizes what is going on. I always tried to grasp the larger picture; go from the general to the specific and not the other way around. Europe and soon America are under invasion. None of the typical Arab countries have taken the Syrian refugees. Fact. Why? Because they want them to overwhelm the western nations. Infiltrate the society. Surround the culture and change civilization as we know it. At that point, it done. Pretty simple, isn it? Sorry, not if I can help it. Islam is a political movement masquerading as a religion.

They know better than to go into a wild animal pens. Plus me and my wife keep our eyes on them all the time. Hands are held too at all times. No excuses for that gorilla to be killed. The parents were neglectful and should be charged with neglect and child endangerment. That gorilla didn't ask to be in the pen. Then to be killed for being a gorilla. I'm not saying leave the kid to die either. Sad situation that should of never happened.","commenter_a":"For all of those slamming the zoo for killing the gorilla, what if it was your kid who fell in?
