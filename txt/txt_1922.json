I don't think that that's any more serious than foreign interests pouring money into a specific candidates election fund or even the main stream running a biased smear campaign to try and get \"their candidate\" elected. It all needs to be stopped.","commenter_a":"So the Russians hacked the Dems servers and released their emails. So what. What does that have to do with Trump? The main stream media was trying its hardest to influence the election for Hillary. Had she won, would people be calling for an investigation of that?","post_message":"So: Shep Smith just called out Donald Trump's lies about Russian election interference on Fox News. \"It was brought up before the election.

We dumb, poor, working class folk are \"sickened\" by rich, elitist, Leftist \"celebrities\" who can afford to live in million dollar homes with high-end security and bodyguards lecturing us for protecting our families and children. Sorry, Amy Schumer, that we can't afford to live in a gated mansion with state of the art alarm systems. But your pal Obama destroyed the American economy.
