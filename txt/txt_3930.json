The truth is Soros owns most of the news media and everyone , including the media, is getting \"paid off these days. I am even starting to believe that our SCOTUS is getting paid for their votes from what I have been seeing lately. After saying all that, what you say is true that people can pick and choose; but we live in a day of uninterested, uninformed, misinformed people who only go with what they hear the most, whether it is factual or not. Do you ever watch \"Watters World\" on the Bill O'Reilly show, \"The Factor\". It is so discouraging to see people of voting age, especially college kids, who are so uninformed, just dumb about history and politics. Maybe you can find it on YouTube ...","commenter_a":"I'm for @username. Donald Trump has nothing on Cruz, but Cruz has on Trump. Cruz is an honest, God fearing man who has been standing up AGAINST Washington ( Washington Cartel is what Ted calls them) ever since he has been a senator. He has fought against democrats AND republicans FOR the choices of the American people. HE never cowered or gave in to Obama's wishes even though he has been falsely accused and criticized for being against Obama policies that Mitch McConnel and John Boehner gave into.","post_message":"An honor to join thousands of courageous conservatives in South Carolina yesterday who agree now is a time to lead and #DefundPlannedParenthood: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153255182937452","commenter_b":"Richard Valdez what's up with that street.
