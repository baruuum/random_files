Second point yes his hands were raised but he moved to the car and did not stop not typical behavior of a stranded motorist when given an order to stop or asked hey why is your car in the road. Third point the suspension is typical following any ois during an investigation. So is the officer right or wrong if you can make that judment based on clips of an entire interaction with the police you're an idiot, and are part of what's wrong with America as well.","post_message":"GRAPHIC VIDEO: Video released today shows Tulsa police shooting and killing Terence Crutcher, an UNARMED father of 4 and college student for the crime of having his car stall down on the road.

The State Department new smoking gun documents put to rest any question about what Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice knew and when they knew it, said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. minutes of the attack, the administration, specifically Hillary Clinton, began lying to the American people by blaming an obscure Internet video. No wonder Hillary Clinton is the great destroyer of State Department emails. One can assume that Mrs. Clinton would not have stolen and destroyed emails in violation of law and various court orders if she didn have something to hide. And it shouldn take a federal court order to find out that Hillary Clinton evidently had no clue how the State Department and the FBI responded to terrorist attacks on State Department personnel."},{"comment_id":"591571124359879","commenter_b":"@username : Educate yourself on the economy No wall it would cost over 530 billion in trade between US and Mexico costing over a million lost jobs in US alone and cause more than 3 states to go bankrupt.
