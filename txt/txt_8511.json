She can spend as much as she wants; I won't vote for her.","commenter_a":"You're spending so much personal time with this little girl.

If they'd vote for someone who votes for war, flip flops on the Keystone pipeline, takes money from Wall Street, and until very recently did not support marriage equality, I don't think they're interested in the truth. They'd rather just take their half truths and stir up crap, just like the candidate they support.","commenter_a":"So many Bernie fans complained that not enough debates were scheduled before the primaries.

Heck, you probably promised her time and a half pay while she was on leave. Extra Holiday pay. The Government will start a college fund for the little toddler, paid for by the 1%.

I bet this was seen as an opportunity and she had someone else bruise her. She did not almost go down and showed no pain or upset on the video. She also shouldn't have approached Trump like that in the crowd. His life has been threatened so someone would have pushed her back. Maybe she should stay home.
