This lawlessness has to stop. There is nothing racist about wanting to enforce laws that apply to everyone. I do hope he can be talked out of the wall though. We need improved cooperation and relations with Mexico. Not a big wall dividing us. Both countries need to crack down on crime and make sure people moving between the two countries do it legally.

Science has proven that life begins at conception. Social injustices continue such as poverty, hunger, underemployment, and child abuse has actually increased. Killing innocent life has not and will not solve these problems. Women and men suffer terrible regret for a decision that can never be reversed. They need real help and healing. The website hopeafterabortion.com offers loving help to post abortive women. Prolife Pregnancy Care Centers offer free nonjudgmental, loving support whether a woman decides to give birth or abort. So many women have been exploited and even died due to abortion. Abortionists get rich killing babies. Planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the United States.
