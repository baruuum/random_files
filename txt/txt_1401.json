Welcome to the new cold war sponsored by peace loving progressive (communist/fascist) liberal globalist Democrats! It's strange to be watching such open minded and tolerant and peace-loving progressives suddenly try and act all hawkish and aggressive and neocon-like by trying to start 3rd world war with Russia. Nice work! Barack Obama and the Democrats are bad losers!","post_message":"\"I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect.”"},{"comment_id":"10153140551051051","commenter_b":"Absolutely. It's a broken system. What I don't get is that in any other country if you enter the country illegally, you get sent back. Why is it soo hard here for that to happen? It's a bigger problem then an illegal person killing another person. Maybe it's time to close the borders and get our country and its laws in order?","commenter_a":"deport trump to mexico...","post_message":"The man who had been deported 5 times before killing an innocent S.F. woman entered a surprising plea.
