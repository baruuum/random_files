And his dumbed down supporters have only remarks about Clinton whenever this ass wipe says and does something outrageously stupid! Shows they have the same low mentality as Trump!

The only thing more shocking than this reckless, short-sighted, last-minute gift to the extreme environmental agenda is that President Obama had the nerve to claim he is doing Alaska a favor. President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there. I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision."}]
