So, I do agree with you just never heard of known a Canadian to come here just to have a baby.","commenter_a":"look people. If you come to this country legally, doing all the appropriate paerwork and forms, any kids you have that are born here will be American Citizens. That won't change. What we want to change is the Anchor Baby tourism that flourishes on the West Coast, with the Asian women travelling here on 'vacation' to have their babaies in specially marketed motels just for them, so that their children, and them by association many times, would be American Citizens. And those illegal immigrants who cross our northern and southern border, from a multitude of countries, who break the law by sneaking in like a thief in the night, who have their babies here hoping for the chance to stay with them. People should not be rewarded fro breaking a law.","post_message":"With a renewed conversation challenging birthright citizenship, a look back at the 1898 case that first established the legal precedent in the U.S."},{"comment_id":"10154355156798812","commenter_b":"Yea these are the very perverted people that will claim to be transgender to gain access into bathrooms...","commenter_a":"The list of perverts who video people in bathrooms is long and does not just stop at Target! My local Old Navy had a perv filming a young girl while she was in a dressing room--her mother caught him in the act. These are not transgenders. These are simply perverted people! I am safer in a restroom with a transgender than I am with \"straight\" people! Transgenders are NOT peeping toms! If men dressing as women and claiming they are transgendered to assault little girls in bathrooms, then maybe there needs to be an anti-creepy men bill, not anti-LGBT bills, targeting Transgenders.","post_message":"Protesters inside North Carolina's statehouse staged symbolic sit-ins outside the offices of top legislative leaders."},{"comment_id":"606800519482594","commenter_b":"HILLARY you have no CREDIBILITY !
