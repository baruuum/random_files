Elderly people do not belong on the road. NOW before you idiots talk crap let me just tell you my father drove until he was 87 years old. When my brother and I reported him to the DMV at 83 years of age he was sly. He just went and took his drive test at the Silverton branch of the DMV and passed because all they had him do was drive around the block.

I am not a fan of any of these idiots running. But Trump has got to go . People are gonna get hurt, innocent people. Look at the monsters he has as his security detail that will swing at anyone for no reason and now this with his supporters. The media has to stop covering him. Take away all the attention he is getting. Maybe cover him when something intelligent comes out of his mouth, which so far has been nothing. This man can say whatever he want but we are a democracy, we have a government and he rant about all he wants to do but he can't do it alone. There are 3 branches of government. I know that he has veto power but then we would be calling him Dictator Trump not President Trump. He is a egotistical classless piece of shit.","post_message":"It's getting worse."},{"comment_id":"10153988549981130","commenter_b":"Why did you even read it WOMAN!?","commenter_a":"I think this tops the most pointless \"article\" I've ever read!","post_message":"Even Jay Z knew to get out of the way."},{"comment_id":"10153840747221336","commenter_b":"Let every congressman in Washington put up 10 \"refugees\" each in their own homes.
