Enact extremely harsh prison sentences and fines for their employers. 2. Cut off all government entitlements to them, including drivers licenses. 3. Open service centers South of the border specializing in United States work permits for any company needing cheap foreign labor. Said employer would be responsible for all housing , food , transportation costs and hospitalization. The only way to get a job here would be to sign up in Mexico! Then wait just like the rest of the world has to. Enact those measures and most will self-deport! Those who don't are criminals and harshly dealt with! All anchor babies should be stripped of citizenship and also deported. Enough of these criminal aliens!","commenter_a":"What George Lopez said ain't much better than what Trump said! They are both wrong! This country was built by immigrants and most of them came here illegally including the white man! The only Americans are the native Americans everyone else is an immigrant! Native Americans didn't invite immigrants here! So don't fool yourselves! White man came here illegally! Massacred native Americans brought black slaves illegally and now have a problem with Mexicans! What a joke! Mexicans don't come here to take your jobs! They do the jobs that your too lazy to do and won't do them!
