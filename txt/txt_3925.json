Just summarized","commenter_a":"Trump had nothing to do with this. This was because Ford, and the UAW were able to work an agreement, Ford is committed to keeping and creating jobs in the U.S. They have created 25,000 new jobs in the U.S. In the past four years. Over 80% of their manufacturing is done in the U.S. And 97% of their engineering is in the U.S. As they stated. No i dont like seeing jobs being outsourced, but Trumps statement had no effect on the outcome of this. Im happy for all the people who kept their jobs. Ford is a great company!
