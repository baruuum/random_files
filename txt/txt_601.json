[{"comment_id":"443733605833672","commenter_b":"Mr. Trump, Your idea of building a wall to slow / prevent illegal immigration is far too narrowly focused. Here is what I think a solution to the problem could be. No matter where the immigrate is coming from. Though not my original idea it is a workable one - All immigrate males between 18 & 50 to be immediately inducted into the military to receive basic training, After completion, sent back to their country of origin, then given their weapons and told to defend and reclaim their own country. After they accomplish that we send them their families because they would have no excuses to come here. If they refuse to do this then they and their families can find another country that will take them because they would never make an AMERICAN anyway. We should not have to send OUR military to their country to fight and die ...","commenter_a":"We don't need 1,400 years of cosanguineous brain damage.
