She was right.","commenter_a":"Actually, The founding fathers were rich aristocrats who valued property rights at a premium, so much so that they limited the right to vote to land owners, who at the time were the billionaires of their day.

George W Bush came along and reaped havoc on every financial sector, leaving millions losing their homes, Savings depleted and left America in the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Barack Obama won the Presidency and without any help from obstructionist Republicans, Obama saved America from another Depression and stabilized America's financial sectors. We need to Support and Vote Hillary Clinton for President of the United States to continue President Obama's Legacy and Policies, building on his successes and making America even greater than what it is. Republicans have been and continues to be America's Greatest Enemy!
