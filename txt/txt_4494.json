She took the process seriously, learning US history, learning english, and working hard to pay the fees. Freely handing out citizenship is an insult to those who went through the process legally. Laws are put in place for a reason, we cant pick and choose which ones we follow. And the President can't be allowed to give millions of people citizenship when it goes against our laws. I don't care if the president is Democrat or Republican, this is not legal.","post_message":"Confident Obama predicts success in immigration appeal, has message for millions facing possible deportation @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"512998138876699","commenter_b":"We certainly need to close our borders, so these warmongering murdering Isis people don't creep in, for that is what they plan to do.

We are not doing enough and hundreds of thousands have died already.","post_message":"To the people of France, we stand united with you and all of France is on our hearts and in our prayers. If history has taught us anything, it proves we must remain vigilant against such cowardly, terrorist attacks. America can lead, and we have the strength to do so, but currently lack the leadership. My hope is that our national leaders grasp why so many Americans, including myself, want the Border secured so that we not only deal with the issue of illegal immigration but we also ensure terrorists do not cross our border to do us harm. Never has the old adage been more true: The World is safer when America is Strong: Our People know it, Our Allies know it, and most importantly, Our Enemies know it."},{"comment_id":"902484503120305","commenter_b":"She will never be a first lady!
