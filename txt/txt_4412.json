Also, her derri√®re is not going to effect the shape of the intake. It is designed to handle air pressure from 250 knot IAS relative wind that at altitude could be as high as 550 knots TAS. So, what's the big deal? I think the picture looks COOL!!!","commenter_a":"I do not think so. The preconditions are whether the company has the clear policy for it, whether she got enough training of behavior in the company?","post_message":"Some passengers who had just boarded a plane at the Chicago Chicago O'Hare International Airport looked out their windows and saw flight attendant Ericka Paige Diehl posing for photos."},{"comment_id":"837279236391341","commenter_b":"She's a stupid twat","commenter_a":"How dumb can any one person be?","post_message":"Come again??"},{"comment_id":"758262410976191","commenter_b":"What a f--king liar!","commenter_a":"Chris is wrong Trump is right.
