All they do is cry about being poor and then vote for people to make them worse instead of seeing a man whos going to build our country full of jobs. Then again many of Obama's supporters are on welfare anyway so theres no speaking to any of you. You are the problem","commenter_a":"This parent is teaching her kids so wrong. She needs to be having her to hold up a Trump/Pence sign for a better future for her and her child. No one wants to live under the reign of Obama anymore and we definitely don't want to have any parts of Hillary Clinton so she can continue the mess that he's made","post_message":"This 4-year-old was inconsolable when she found out Obama was leaving office  she wants four more years!  #MicBrights"},{"comment_id":"10152526898447623","commenter_b":"No. The statue was in HONOR of our fallen heroes.

If you have to murder physicians who perform a legal medical procedure, heavily edit videos to try to discredit an organization that is doing nothing illegal and burn down their clinics, then who is really the violent killers and terrorists here? All in the name of Christianity? Not my Christianity certainly. Reminds me of the middle east, however. Islamic terrorists/Christian terrorists. There is no difference when you cross the line into violence.","commenter_a":"Damm","post_message":"\"It's deeply disappointing that we still see the kind of hateful rhetoric in our state that fuels this kind of violence.\""}]
