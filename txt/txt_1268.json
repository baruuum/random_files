And my question is how can you hate war refugees, and many of them children, and still claim you're Christian. The tenet of the religion is to care for the stranger, the wretched, and the sick. Not sure what part of that is hard to understand. Jesus was a refugee, and so were his parents, we seem to forget that. Bravo to the troops, they're doing the right thing.","post_message":"Kudos to these vets for speaking out against Trump."},{"comment_id":"10154793363900575","commenter_b":"Fucking right a wall","commenter_a":"You have a wall?

That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in Chapter 2 ACT 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by 'force, violence, or other unconstitutional means.' This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.Islamic immigration to the US would be prohibited under this law because the Koran, Sharia Law and the Hadith all require complete submission ...","commenter_a":"Don't waste tax dollars with a trial, start setting an example of what happens to terrorest who murder.","post_message":"BREAKING: Muslim Teen Refugee Charged With MURDER For Beating 97-Yr-Old WWII Veteran To Death  These refugees can not be trusted with freedom... give an inch they take a mile.
