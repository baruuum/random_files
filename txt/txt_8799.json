But if you want to talk about the Metro Detroit area as a whole there are some really beautiful women in the area. I was at Exodos rooftop (in Greektown) in the Summer a couple years back talking to a girl that was there from Philly and she said how good looking everyone was. The Albanian and Chaldean women in Metro Detroit are GORGEOUS. The city itself might not be the prettiest but there are some beautiful foreign women in the area.

Admittedly, this is the first campaign in my memory in which one candidate actually called the other a ‚Äúmonster.‚Äù But one woman who finds Hillary‚Äôs behavior truly monstrous has finally put her name and face behind that charge.
