First the US gov attacks its own people on 9.11 in false flag operation 2. They blame the attack on Osama Bin Ladin, a fictitious character created by the CIA and played by several actors. 3.

They are Hondurans and Egyptians and Libyans who have been subjugated by the regimes in their countries, regimes that only exist because we can't seem to keep our fingers out of everyone else's pie. Neoliberal policy has caused more suffering in this world than even Trump promises to bring. Secondly, voting in line with ones genuine ideology is not reprehensible in the slightest.
