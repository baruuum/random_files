I just want to thank all the people who were here when we were at our worst.","commenter_a":"Very cool","post_message":"WATCH: Educators in Lumberton, NC, hit hard by Hurricane Matthew, get $50,000, a brand new playground and funds to rebuild 16 parks! @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153738741461491","commenter_b":"women, so weak they shouldn't even be acknowledged in movies as worthy of a fight...","commenter_a":"I don't see it as offensive.
