And of course they do numbers most ppl think the radio is all there Is to offer. And I'd say 3 ouuta 4 drake fans r girls. Drake can go hard but he chooses not to cuz that don't sell albums to women...so instead he's like \"long as my bitches love me\" lol","commenter_a":"It's funny how people who don't like hip-hop or don't like Drake's music post derogatory comments .If you don't like it don't post it,I think music like Young Thug(or when Gucci Mane was hot) & HALF of what I hear on the radio is trash lyrically but perfect for a party,but I don't sound off on it b/c the numbers that these songs/mixtapes/albums do,speak for themselves regardless of what we as neigh-sayers,b/c it's not our cup of tea,may say about it.Although I am biased to Drake's music,I love music period so why don't we all just take a lil advice from a19 year old(myself) & actually be grown about what we post instead of being ignorant cause honestly,8 times out of 10,nothing we say is taken into major consideration by the famous.In the words of Kevin Durant,\"Why do you tweet?\" lol...dang","post_message":"Is it an album? Is it a mixtape? Who cares? The 17 tracks Drake released at midnight last Thursday hit harder and hold together more cohesively than most big-budget event albums.

Because you have been such a good friend and a strong supporter of all my efforts, I wanted you to know first that tonight I will do more than just say goodnight on my Fox show.  I will say goodbye.  This is the last edition of Huckabee on the Fox News Channel. It has been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasn¹t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.  There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President.  I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support.  As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to leave a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America.  I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"},{"comment_id":"10152733923177217","commenter_b":"Probably think females don't know anything about cars.","commenter_a":"Another keyboard warrior.","post_message":"TV presenter in Twitter break after Top Gear \"threats\""},{"comment_id":"10154077308573128","commenter_b":"would they let someone come in and do this to the liars Scruz and Ruby!","commenter_a":"When's the next GOP Debate?","post_message":"Republican leaders who had hoped Trump would stumble on Super Tuesday now face tough choices, writes Gerald F.
