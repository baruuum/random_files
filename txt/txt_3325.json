And his dumbed down supporters have only remarks about Clinton whenever this ass wipe says and does something outrageously stupid! Shows they have the same low mentality as Trump! Trump doesn't have the smarts or the temperament for this position. Anyone who would want this dummy anywhere near some nuclear button are just as delusional as Trump or just as dumb and sure don't give two shits about this country!
