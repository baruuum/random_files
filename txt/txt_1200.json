Land of the free, home of the brave? Nope, not so much because those brown people scare me! And who determines how many Muslims in one neighborhood is enough to warrant this police state attention?

Would that qualify as a \"Muslim neighborhood\"? Jesus, these guys are scary. Bomb, kill, torture, create Muslim ghettos inside the United States.
