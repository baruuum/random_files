He would've been painted an insider since government is all he knows. They planned to trot out his rape fantasy story as well. Also, Vermont tried and failed it's statewide Healthcare for all system. He was treated with kid gloves compared to what he would've endured against the Trump post-truth machine.","commenter_a":"Sorry, Bill, but half of America already hated her BEFORE she ran. The media and Republicans have been excoriating her for 30 years. SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE--unlike Bernie, who was almost universally beloved. He would have won. Fault: Democrats","post_message":"In case you missed them, we're counting down the most popular stories on BillMoyers.com during the past year: #9 - The fact is that Hillary Clinton wasnâ€™t unpopular when she announced her decision to run in April 2015. If you look at the Gallup survey in March of 2015, 50 percent of Americans had a favorable impression of Clinton, only 39 percent an unfavorable one. So there was clearly no deep reservoir of Clinton hatred among the general public at the time. On the contrary: Americans liked her; they liked her quite a bit. Hillary Clinton's popularity didn't start to plummet until the press focus turned to her emails."},{"comment_id":"10154013196294411","commenter_b":"Oh with hijab!absolutely she cover herself from you rapist pornographers.","commenter_a":"Americans should be blessed with islam for taking them to the right path","post_message":"They have always seen Iraq as a threat because it has the great potential to be a great regional independent power in its own right.

No one wanted them in the first place. Replace all the female flight attendants with young good-looking strippers. They don't even serve food anymore, so what's the loss. The strippers would at least triple the alcohol sales and get a \"party atmosphere\" going in the cabin. And, of course, every businessman in this country would start flying again, hoping to see naked women. Because of the tips, female flight attendants wouldn't need a salary, thus saving even more money. Muslims would be afraid to get on the planes for fear of seeing naked women. Hijackings would come to a screeching halt, and the airline industry would see record revenues. This is definitely a win - win situation if we handle it right -- a golden opportunity to turn a liability into an asset. Why didn't Bush or Obama think of this?
