Only God knows what was in her mind. One thing for sure though, its alive n has chance to be somebody. Not just an aborted baby thrown in a trash can or its innocent body parts sold on the black market. Evil comes in all shapes n sizes. One of them is planned parenthood.","commenter_a":"I'm glad she didn't abort the baby, but this is still a sad story. Calling it a \"selfless\" act, as this article does, is a head scratcher. \"Desperate\" maybe, but if anything, abandoning a baby without notifying anyone is exactly the opposite of selfless. There are safe havens in NY where she could have turned over the baby to actual people","post_message":"\"I followed the cries.
