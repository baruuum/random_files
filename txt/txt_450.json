Republicans never gave President Obama a chance. They blamed him for everything and they worked tirelessly to make him a one term president. If Trump wins America will be the laughing stock. Even the Russian government knows that. Donald a Trump blames everyone democrats for everything that is wrong but he has yet to say how he's going make America great again. Unless building a wall to keep out the illegals is how few intends to make America great again. I was team Bernie but since he didn't make the cut I have to go with the lesser of two evils. I can't vote for someone who fuels hate and bigotry.","commenter_a":"It's not up to this man to judge anyone soul.

They are a whole level of crazy I don't want to be around. Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other! I can't wait for the future of America!üá∫üá∏üöÇ‚ù§Ô∏è","commenter_a":"Our country is full of spoiled people who are so used to having things their way, they act like a class of 5 y/o kids who didn't get the green marker! Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was 'stronger together, peace, love, equality'......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters. Your example is clear.","post_message":"Protesters burned American flags and chanted 'not my president' despite Democrats' calls for a peaceful transition of power."},{"comment_id":"10153347951697144","commenter_b":"that's most likely it - when people camp out, they live somewhere, and the fault line between public and private gets blurred.","commenter_a":"why didn't they want the press there?","post_message":"Finally."},{"comment_id":"10153778472068984","commenter_b":"She doesn't owe anyone anything, much less a fucking apology lol","commenter_a":"Carly, how can someone so well versed on most subjects, be so uninformed on Muslims? Even Muslims know Islam is not a religion but an ideology of submission only. Therefore you owe Ben Carson an apology for being correct when he said they are not covered under OUR constitution. READ the Quran for yourself Carly and you will find out that you are an Infidel and are to be killed if you do not SUBMIT to Allah. Does that sound like someone our constitution would support? I think NOT!","post_message":"Carly Fiorina just revealed what she thinks about Ben Carson's comments about a Muslim serving as President of the United States - and you might be surprised with where she stands...
