For me it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of her skin or the shape of her body as a human resources manager I have had to have many a talk with white, brown, and black women regarding their inappropriate attire. That's what dress codes in the workplace are for. FYI men also come to work in inappropriate attire. They tend to dress sloppy, they don't bath, and when they think they're sexy they tend to show us way more than we want to see. So it works both ways.","post_message":"It isn't the clothes they have an issue with."},{"comment_id":"536487383205696","commenter_b":"Here's some facts for you Gerry - I NEVER want to be someone's \"arm candy\", I will NEVER marry for money and I don't have relationships with people because of the way they look.
