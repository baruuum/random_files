These people are Muslims as maybe you are. Their ideology is to secede as supreme at any cost including the taking of life to advance their cause. Allowing 10,000 to come to this Country, and not knowing who they really are, is not a smart idea nor is it responsible. We have enough problems in this Country now with illegals and supporting them. We don't need more leaches to feed. And yes, I am a proud Southerner as you have mentioned. Your history is somewhat flawed and Gods laws supersedes mans laws.","commenter_a":"9/11...\"We will never forget\"!

Not because it was offensive or anything, but because it seemed to take what is clearly an issue (people taking up too much space on the subway) that can be caused by *both genders* (not just men) and acted like men were silly for thinking the ads were sexist by only targeting men. How much outrage would there be if there were a series of ads specifically targeting women for doing something that both men and women could do? Food for thought.","post_message":"\"Occupying all the territory you can is sexy.

I can just tell you it is wrong because of decay and expansion. We know that the universe was something different even if that was just a tiny speck.
