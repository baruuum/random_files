People who are so close minded that they can't see out their \"perfect little bubble\" and judge anyone and everyone different than them. I love my generation because we are some accepting individuals. We want equality for all because WE ARE ALL HUMAN!! why does it matter to YOU personally what genitals someone has/wants. Who they lay down with behind closed doors. Why is considered \"crazy\" for the parents to support THEIR child's dreams and aspirations. Like got damn lady.

Quran (9:73) - \"O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.\" Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter. It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith.","post_message":"We as a company have aired or released many horrible images in our short tenure as a media outlet, none of which have risen to the level of depravity of the images of Lt.

We had chosen not to release these images out of respect for the victim, his family and his countrymen, but also because we do not wish to spread fear and the message of psychopathic killers.
