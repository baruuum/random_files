Unlike the Nazis, these Islamists will NOT be sent to concentration or death camps. They will be sent to their homes to stop their invasion of other lands. But we must say things that are NOT politically correct and follow those with actions if we are to survive these Islamic horde. Once they have enough power to resist, then it would be too late. Now is the time to deport, expel or arrest them. Now not later.","post_message":"VIDEO: RAW footage from the terrorist attack in Paris!"},{"comment_id":"10153575411863132","commenter_b":"I don't think she did either...","commenter_a":"I Don't believe she killed him...he was negligible to wearing proper gear... he took a big chance and lost his life... just plain STUPID!

Quran (9:73) - \"O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.\" Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter. It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith.","post_message":"We as a company have aired or released many horrible images in our short tenure as a media outlet, none of which have risen to the level of depravity of the images of Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbehâ€™s death. We had chosen not to release these images out of respect for the victim, his family and his countrymen, but also because we do not wish to spread fear and the message of psychopathic killers. This morning, I, as the owner and operator of TheBlaze, have changed my mind. After looking at the images again, I believe it is important for the world to see them. We have been lured into a poppy field where we have fallen fast asleep as grave danger quickly approaches. It is time to wake up. This is the enemy of all mankind.

Thats antifeminist. Further, you are aaying women, by nature, are easily manipulated and dont know whats good for them, and thats also antifeminist.
