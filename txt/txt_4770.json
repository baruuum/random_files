No one wants to take the chance of harboring snakes on their own homeland, before long this migrant group would breed like crazy and before long their population would be 40 p.c or more and they might get some enlightenment and start bombing the locals.. The problem with most muslims, is they are always muslims first. They are not british, germans, australians, americans..There identity is muslim first and that's why its hard to trust loyalty of someone whose citizenship comes second to the God..These people can easily be blinded. From birth they are taught to prepare for heaven, if only they had such devotion for their mother land. Be it, wherever they are born, what ever citizenship they hold. The greed of heaven and fear of hell has done more bad to man than good.","commenter_a":"Oh no, of course not!","post_message":"Slovakian minister insists it's not discrimination."},{"comment_id":"690670874378549","commenter_b":"God I know!
