I don't like the word used by any person but it definitely should not be said by him.","commenter_a":"You have the right to say whatever you want. The question is, do you have enough respect for others to know you shouldn't?","post_message":"Rapper Chet Haze, the son of Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks and actress Rita Wilson, says that the slur is part of hip-hop culture and that he has a right to say it."},{"comment_id":"10152765303355950","commenter_b":"@username, \"Ridiculous comment. The complete opposite of what we should take away from this as feminists. Imagine what would happen if all of the barricades were removed & women could advance the way men do. Even more women would be standing where she is.\" Okay, so support your putative position with evidence, versus just asserting it like your job is done.","commenter_a":"Great! Now feminists can see that it is by working hard, getting really lucky, and not giving up that we are best equipped to fulfill our dreams, rather than trying to reengineer society... like the whole thing is just broken. Even the grass can get through concrete... with enough time and the right conditions.","post_message":"At 19 years old, Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of college. She had a little money and a big idea.

They love to rape. That's it.","commenter_a":"Im still confused. Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. üòï","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"10154493541114060","commenter_b":"Karolina Kulewicz yeyeee","commenter_a":"Congrats Daniel your city came second again!
