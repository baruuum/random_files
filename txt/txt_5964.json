Politicians need to smile for likability. Likability is crucial in a candidate. It's why a sweating Nixon went down to JFK. It's why the trope of \"kissing babies\" became a thing for politicians of any level. When I think of male pols who didn't smile, they didn't do so hot. Your Bob Doles, your Ralph Naders, your Jim Webbs. All pols need to be likable, and I can remember accounts of the \"dourness\" of the above males mentioned in the news, but when it's mentioned about a woman, it's not okay? She's running for President, this is fair commentary.","post_message":"Were other (male) candidates called out the same way?"},{"comment_id":"1238572816162746","commenter_b":"...aaaaaand to jail this woman will go.","commenter_a":"A real action star.
