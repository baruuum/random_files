I saw another comment somewhere else from an actual member at the pool. This was a members (HOA) only pool where there WAS several BLACK members and was present at the time. There was a private pool party going on where the DJ that was hired sent out a tweet about was he was doing. The pool was swarmed by kids from another neighborhood with no pass and uninvited. Which is technically \"trespassing\". They was asked to leave and started a fight in which the cops was called. The police had made several requests to leave with no luck. This girl ( if you watch the full video) was asked to leave several times and told the officer \" F-YOU\" and that's when the officer grabbed her. First off she and the rest was trespassing and second refused to leave when asked. @webpagelink","post_message":"A young woman who attended the McKinney pool party gives her explanation for \"how it all began.\" Watch the full interview here: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154022766707693","commenter_b":"Another idiot spending American tax dollars to pay for illegals to be here with American tax dollars.
