A genetically male transgender would (quite correctly) not be allowed to compete in a woman's race whereas a genetically female transgender would only get beaten were she to compete in a male race. Caster is (it seems) totally different. If an intersex she has two X chromosomes that would normally make a female but, unlike true females she also possesses male Y chromosomes that will give some male characteristics. If she has Y chromosomes then she isn't qualified to compete in female races but, as with female transgenders, there is little point in her trying (and she should not with two X chromosomes) to compete in male races.","post_message":"South African runner Caster Semenya dominated the women's 800-meter final Saturday in Rio, finishing well ahead of the competition to take home the gold medal.

Germany is expected to accept 800,000 refugees this year, while the US has accepted less than 1,000 thus far. Let's do a small part to encourage the U.S. government to be socially responsible.
