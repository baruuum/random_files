The paperwork is difficult and the cost somewhat prohibitive.Add to that English is not their native language and it becomes nearly impossible. When a mexican national pays $2500-4000 to a coyote to bring him here because it's easier and cheaper, it screams how broken our system is and how strongly we ask those who truly want to come here and work, to do it illegally. We make it easier to break the law than to obey it. We, the American people are complicit in this crime at present. This activity encourages the welfare state, trains new citizens to act irresponsibly, and costs the working class American tens of thousands of dollars each for this miscarriage of justice.","commenter_a":"Wanna know how precious your American Citizenship is?
