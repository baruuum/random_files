Businesses used to post signs such as \"Help Wanted--Irish Need Not Apply\" or of course Jim Crow laws. Would you seriously be okay with the return of Jim Crow? Businesses have discriminated in horribly blatant ways. Up until just a few years ago women weren't allowed to be members of all sorts of organizations even though there was nothing about the organization that was impossible for women (they were mostly golf and country clubs). We've had 50 years of the Civil Rights Act which people seem happy to toss out the window. If that were to happen, you yourself could easily be discriminated against with no recourse. Please read some civil rights history and see what incredibly horrible things were said and done to decent, hard-working ...","commenter_a":"I thought a private business owner reserved the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. We have a sign up at work that says exactly that. I may think his is a dumb reason (even though to him it is not), but he is a private business owner operating on private property and should have the right to do business with whomever he wishes, and not do business with whomever he doesn't wish to do business with. That being said, I wonder what he'd say if he tried to go into a diner for lunch and saw a sign that said \"No Christians allowed.\"","post_message":"A Florida gun supply owner says his store is now a ‚ÄúMuslim-free zone‚Äù -- after the deadly shooting in Tennessee.

Sorry but I'm tired of idiots like Dee. Yes Dee it's called artificial insemination. I highly doubt anyone doing this would get an abortion.","commenter_a":"That MOTHER LOVING USED ASS WIPE thinks EVERYONE should WORSHI{_ HIS GODDESS, Ayn Rand, and that EVERYONE should be SELF-SUFFICIENT. Oh yeah, He is ADDICTED to TAXPAYER-FINANCED salary and TAXPAYER-FINSANCED health care. HIS ROTTEN KIDS would STARVE if he weren't a USELESS, WORTHLESS MOOCHEZR.

However, I have to wonder at the ethics. Performing a surgery that has major repercussions for the woman involved (anti-rejection meds, etc...) just so she can undergo pregnancy- which has its own set of dangers - seems ethically sketchy. There are so many unwanted children who need homes. Adopt.","post_message":"This is truly amazingThe Cleveland Clinic said the nine-hour surgery was performed on a 26-year-old woman, using a uterus from a deceased donor."},{"comment_id":"1539146466096818","commenter_b":"üòÅüòÅ","commenter_a":"I am starting to think this entire administration was homeschooled by Betsy DeVos.","post_message":"Her (lack of) explanation left Matt Lauer flabbergasted."}]
