I have contacts within both campaigns. Here what I was told yesterday and today. Clinton campaign to vote down every concession made to Bernie on the platform if he did not endorse her prior to the convention. Knowing that Superdelegates were not going to switch to his side without something major happening, the best he could do was hold on to the progressive concessions he won for US on the platform. He could not, in good consciousness let the GOP and Trump win, especially when we have a potential half of the Supreme Court Justices that will be replaced within the next 4-8 years. He was looking out for the future of our movement and our nation in this very hard decision he made. This post is not to tell you to vote for Hillary, or to not leave ...","post_message":"In the coming weeks, I will be announcing the creation of successor organizations to carry on the struggle that we have been a part of these past 15 months.

People came from other towns and cities with food and other things that were badly needed during this time. I understand these ladies went above and beyond and for that I applaud them. But we should not forget all the other people that helped and are still here helping. While the kids are a very important part of our community there are still people working to rebuild what has taken them a lifetime to obtain. I just want to thank all the people who were here when we were at our worst.","commenter_a":"Very cool","post_message":"WATCH: Educators in Lumberton, NC, hit hard by Hurricane Matthew, get $50,000, a brand new playground and funds to rebuild 16 parks! @webpagelink"}]
