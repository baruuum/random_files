He has every right to refuse and shouldn't be forced to preform a same sex marriage if it's against his beliefs!!","commenter_a":"I am supporting the judge who didn't marry the same-sex couple. If gays and lesbians demand justice they also should let those who differ in thought the same right to practice what they believe instead, of trying to force someone to commit something that goes against what they belief..","post_message":"This judge's response has him in hot water. You'll be surprised when you learn his background, then when you see who stepped in for him -- you'll be even more surprised. A totally backwards scenario from what you'd expect...

We deserve the right to help those who earn the right to be Americans , but not those who come to take, hate, criticize and try to change America to suit their needs.

Man has done enough damage to Africa. The west needs to stick it's hand in its pocket and spend the money to educate them and show them how to diversify their economy so they don't need to rely on sports hunting. It's not sport to hunt and kill these beautiful animals.","commenter_a":"The UN should encourage all nations to make it illegal for their citizens to go to Africa and hunt the Lion or any other African wildlife.","post_message":"A small victory for the king of beasts:"},{"comment_id":"10154362784109062","commenter_b":"‚ù§Ô∏è","commenter_a":"Praying for the family...","post_message":"A heartbreaking loss for a family after a 14-year-old boy collapsed and died after school in Cleveland, Texas.
