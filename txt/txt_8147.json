He encourages sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants and lets them get drivers licenses and so with liberals it's take from the people who work and pay taxes and let them pay for all the illegals. I don't want to give my hard earned money to whatever the state chooses to spend it on but liberals will continue until they are ousted. And that goes for Republicans as well. No one in either party deserves to hold office if \"our\" welfare doesn't come first. And I don't mean welfare as in free stuff.","commenter_a":"what...how can any illegal alien hold a government position?
