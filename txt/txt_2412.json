An America that believes healthcare costs for many Americans should increase? I get that the Affordable Healthcare Act has helped millions Americans, but at the expense of millions of other Americans. Also, an America that believes it's ok to accept donations from countries that house terrorists and are suspected of funding them? An America that let's people get away with breaking certain laws?

Hickenlooper is putting Colorado communities at risk as well as the Federal Government! 26 States as of today have refused to take any. Less States mean more refugees per State. Obama wants upwards of 200,000 refugees! If we would have wiped them out early, the world would not be in this position! How many refugees would we receive in your State if only 10, 5 or 2 States allow them? They will migrate to other states and most will go on welfare, food stamps and Obama care, not to mention the cost to educate them or the real cost of American lives from terrorist attacks in our communities! What price do you put on that Mr Speaker!? Hickenlooper as well as the Federal is putting our communities at a security risk ...","post_message":"Our nation has always been welcoming, but we can‚Äôt let terrorists take advantage of our compassion.
