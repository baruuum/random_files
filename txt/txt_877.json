Others were willing to issue the licenses.","post_message":"Today, judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny. Today, for the first time ever, the government arrested a Christian woman for living according to her faith. This is wrong. This is not America.  I stand with Kim Davis. Unequivocally. I stand with every American that the Obama Administration is trying to force to choose between honoring his or her faith or complying with a lawless court decision.  In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts rightly observed that the Court’s marriage decision has nothing to do with the Constitution. Justice Scalia observed that the Court’s decision was so contrary to law that state and local officials would choose to defy it.  For every politician — Democrat and Republican — who is tut-tutting that Davis must resign, they are defending a hypocritical standard. Where is the call for the mayor of San Francisco to resign for creating a sanctuary city — resulting in the murder of American citizens by criminal illegal aliens welcomed by his lawlessness?  Where is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws, our welfare reform laws, and even his own Obamacare?  When the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.  Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office. That is the consequence of their position. Or, if Christians do serve in public office, they must disregard their religious faith–or be sent to jail.  Kim Davis should not be in jail. We are a country founded on Judeo-Christian values, founded by those fleeing religious oppression and seeking a land where we could worship God and live according to our faith, without being imprisoned for doing so.  I call upon every Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis. Stop the persecution now."},{"comment_id":"10156335806925725","commenter_b":"ahahah im sorry you said lead... omg kill yourself please xD","commenter_a":"President Obama is being a leader - something that Donald Trump only dreams of.","post_message":"What is our President doing?"},{"comment_id":"10154316931887654","commenter_b":"it's with the thieves,rapists and murderers! this lady is a witch!","commenter_a":"It's hard to believe that she has enough brain to keep her breathing...........The woman is a grieving mother whose son was murdered by someone who should not have been here.

A child is not a child until it is born. 2. Her body, her right. 3. What if she was suffering complications from said pregnancy? What if she was raped? What if it was incest? Would you still argue that she hasn't the right? Because if so, you're giving a living woman less bodily autonomy than a corpse.","commenter_a":"good","post_message":"There has been no time since Roe v.

That is a reflection of voters failing to elect officials who actually do their job. Our government was originally structured in order to make congress the most powerful branch. Unfortunately, modern Americans think the president holds all of the power and are far too ignorant of what their congressmen are doing. Despite an approval rating below 40%, reelection rates within congress are still at 96%. That is your problem, not the president. Granted, Obama doesn't really help matters, but even as a republican I must concede that it isn't ALL his fault, and quite honestly regardless of the fact that he is a poor president there are no grounds for impeachment.","commenter_a":"Why don't you impeach this man.
