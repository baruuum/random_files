I saw another comment somewhere else from an actual member at the pool. This was a members (HOA) only pool where there WAS several BLACK members and was present at the time. There was a private pool party going on where the DJ that was hired sent out a tweet about was he was doing. The pool was swarmed by kids from another neighborhood with no pass and uninvited. Which is technically \"trespassing\". They was asked to leave and started a fight in which the cops was called. The police had made several requests to leave with no luck. This girl ( if you watch the full video) was asked to leave several times and told the officer \" F-YOU\" and that's when the officer grabbed her. First off she and the rest was trespassing and second refused to leave when asked. @webpagelink","post_message":"A young woman who attended the McKinney pool party gives her explanation for \"how it all began.\" Watch the full interview here: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1570942919862279","commenter_b":"@username how about keeping your dick in your pants if all you men are going to do is walk away.....","commenter_a":"58 million human babies have been victims of abortion in the past 43 years since Roe vs Wade legalized abortion through all 9 months of pregnancy.

Killing innocent life has not and will not solve these problems. Women and men suffer terrible regret for a decision that can never be reversed. They need real help and healing. The website hopeafterabortion.com offers loving help to post abortive women. Prolife Pregnancy Care Centers offer free nonjudgmental, loving support whether a woman decides to give birth or abort. So many women have been exploited and even died due to abortion. Abortionists get rich killing babies. Planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the United States. They do not provide any prenatal care or even mammograms.
