If I'm in a relationship, I am entitled to sex. If she won't provide, I can find someone who will. Using sex as a weapon against men is ABUSE.","commenter_a":"Problem is there are too many uptight women out there. Articles like this don't help either. 'Intimacy'. Words like that make sex sound like some mythical state of enlightenment that we are trying to achieve. When the fact is its just some good old hard core fucking. Get all the mind fuck thoughts out your head and get sucking or licking and you'll soon get into it. We've had hard core porn for years now showing us how to get down and dirty with it so stop making a big deal about it.

This evening Tim Kaine demonstrated that he would serve as just another enabler of the failed Obama-Clinton policies that have hurt our economy, taken away our freedom, and weakened our security. The choice for Americans is clear. We cannot afford a third term of President Obama, and Clinton-Kaine would only continue the disastrous policies of the last eight years."}]
