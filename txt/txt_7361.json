Deplorables say Hillary is an enabler for standing by her cheating husband.... But Melania is a good wife for standing by her twice divorced husband who cheated on her while she was pregnant? Hypocrisy is the running mate of Donald Trump. And sexual assault. Don't forget that. #GrabThemByThePu$$y #MakeSexualAssaultGreatAgain","post_message":"\"Everyone knows how bright she is and how resilient she is, but...they're going to see how much she cares.\" â€”Joe Biden"},{"comment_id":"10153864923562490","commenter_b":"Women do not belong on boats or in combat this is just common sense and has everything to do with sex...","commenter_a":"Being a navy veteran, I don't agree with this.

There is NO basis to convict her of any wrong doing. The Republicans have lied about her for years and I'm sure they will continue. In the meantime I won't vote for anyone as repulsive as Donald Trump. He will, in my opinion, destroy this Country and our reputation around the World.","post_message":"How does this make ANY sense? From CNN: \"Donald Trump may say he's concerned about the little guy, but his tax plan would give the wealthy far bigger breaks than the middle class or working Americans.

Withdrawing support from Awful Trump means conceding power to awful Hillary and the equally awful Democrats. The only way to break this power struggle is to elect more third party candidates that will force our elected public servants to compromise for the benefit of the American People.","post_message":"It's time for John McCain and other Republican leaders to set an example for their party by withdrawing support for Donald J.
