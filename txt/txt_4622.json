If you watch a video of people getting assaulted and are ok with it then you don't have much of a moral character. Why should America allow illegal immigrants to keep coming in and why shouldn't we have the ones here deported? There are legal ways of coming to this country use that rout and people will respect you more. Don't want to become legal then don't come to the USA.

She has admitted that her staff reviewed all her emails so they could delete her \"Personal emails\", right? Since this occurred AFTER she left the government, it is an admission of guilt!!! Why? It is a violation of law to reveal or share classified information with anyone that does not have a current active security clearance equal to or exceeding the classification of the material. Further it is required that the person have a \"need to know\" even if they have security clearance. Since her staff has neither a current and active security clearance or even if some did they did not have a need to know. Since it is now known that some of those emails were Top Secret SAP it is virtually certain none of those staff were listed as having access.
