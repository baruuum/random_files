Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. 😕","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"1326722587387039","commenter_b":"Lock her up!","commenter_a":"These people man!","post_message":"Guess what her alias is..."}]
