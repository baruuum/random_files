They patrolled by cops. An if did know this after 9/11 the FBI and NAS already monitor communication it those communities than to the Patriot Act. So what Ted Cruz is talk is already being done. What Ted Cruz really wants to do like communist leaders would do in term of monitor arrest you and in prison you with any form of guilt. He want to doing like Castro. It's funny Ted Cruz father escaped Cuba to get away from communism. No Ted Cruz is advocating the same communist view his father escaped from.

If you're not a citizen, you don't get to vote. If undocumented get amnesty (which can only be done by Congress), that doesn't necessarily make them a citizen.
