The people who fought and died for that Flag to fly is the reason these a-holes can be protesting in the first place. I would put them on a plane like the other person said, but instead of flying to ISIS country, I would just drop them out over the middle of the Atlantic and see how well they swim. Hopefully they will swim in the other direction from our Country!","post_message":"The protesters in Cleveland thought they could get away with burning an American flag in the streets... but they never expected who was coming right for them.
