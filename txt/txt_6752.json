Or is it also as offensive to black person if their their own race uses the word to announce their friendship\"? What up my n..... You all have heard it. Its in every horrible rap lyric. Its used daily in schools and on the streets. RESPECT IS RESPECT. there is no off time when the word is offensive or not. So its an honest question. Why is it Not offensive in music or when used by black people toward other black people?","post_message":"I'M SORRY: One Desert Vista High School senior, who posed for a picture while spelling out a racial slur, apologized yesterday during a rally.
