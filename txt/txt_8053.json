Ponder that statement for a minute, because it is the truth. If you are black, eventually racism will most likely lead to the cause of your death, whether it is diet, subsequently health, or murder. The degree of oppression will take its toll. Dying of a natural cause is a luxury that few blacks will enjoy, and by natural cause, I refer to old age only. The degree in which we are hated is only mildly expressed in this video. The odd man out is usually hated with a vengeance, and we been tasked with that role since day one.
