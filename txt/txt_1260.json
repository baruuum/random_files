Businesses used to post signs such as \"Help Wanted--Irish Need Not Apply\" or of course Jim Crow laws. Would you seriously be okay with the return of Jim Crow? Businesses have discriminated in horribly blatant ways. Up until just a few years ago women weren't allowed to be members of all sorts of organizations even though there was nothing about the organization that was impossible for women (they were mostly golf and country clubs). We've had 50 years of the Civil Rights Act which people seem happy to toss out the window. If that were to happen, you yourself could easily be discriminated against with no recourse.

We have a sign up at work that says exactly that.

That being said, I wonder what he'd say if he tried to go into a diner for lunch and saw a sign that said \"No Christians allowed.\"","post_message":"A Florida gun supply owner says his store is now a “Muslim-free zone” -- after the deadly shooting in Tennessee.
