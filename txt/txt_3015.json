That 1/2 had a crowd, the rest of the mall was sparsely filled but you could only see that from an ariel view. Crowd scientists say Trump's inauguration crowd was half the size of Obama's and they are correct, especially when you compare views of both ends of the mall--anyway--who really cares about this anymore?","commenter_a":"Obama was the first African American president I would expect the crowd to be quite larger for him","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10152822135907434","commenter_b":"You are no gentleman.","commenter_a":"Sure, dude.","post_message":"\"It‚Äôs not just about me.

Sit behind a computer screen and throw insults around like you are all important.
