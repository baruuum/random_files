Its not my fault that youre too much of an idiot that you cant see that. And because of our backwards government giving handouts to everyone of these assholes, theres not enough resources left to give them to the people who really deserve them.

Basically the way it would work though is if impeachment is not possible, a no confidence vote by congress could in effect say we no longer recognize this Presidents authority. Members of congress can be sanctioned, why not the POTUS?","commenter_a":"What we need is Nation wide non-compliance with, or recognition of authority, or any further orders coming out of the White House. Personally I think a no confidence vote is in order. Write your Congress and demand the sanctioning of the President until the end of his term, for gross executive over reach and abuse of power.","post_message":"The president continues to show his disregard for millions of Americans with his 'Bathroom Order,' never bothering to consult with parents. Instead, he decided to issue an order threatening the loss of funding and lawsuits from the government to schools that don't comply."}]
