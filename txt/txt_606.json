Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz.
