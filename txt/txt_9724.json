The racist abuse that comes from people who have no rights to be here, is killing our country. EU is based on lies and corruption, people need to be protected from people who have no respect for the British people. Immigration need to be stamped out people who are not suppose to be here should be returned home. Enough of the rubbish people keep trying to push the boundaries of the country to an extent of hatered breeding in a peaceful country. Stay campaign maybe help all those who have no rights to be here, leave campaign had been made to rebuild their country for those who live for the moment.","commenter_a":"A \"so-called\" majority can be wrong. The referendum was a bad idea. The parliament are the elected representatives meant to lead and decide. It's a bad outcome for everyone, and is a very bad example to all in the world on how to get along in the global economy, and especially from a social perspective. We live on the same planet. We're not going anywhere else soon. We should share it. Borders are historically recent and arbitrary. Nationality is random (not a choice where you are born, just luck). It is not the most important thing. We all belong to the same human race.","post_message":"Join our live debate and tell us where you stand on a second referendum on leaving the EU."},{"comment_id":"895405060572025","commenter_b":"Just like that nut","commenter_a":"Looks to me Democrats are pretty scared of Trump and that way they send these people to his campaigning events and start up problems, fights in crowds.
