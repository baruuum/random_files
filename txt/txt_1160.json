Elsewhere in the world, Tuesday marked the 50th anniversary of the Race Relations Act in the UK, which outlaws discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origin.

Majority of the military that protects this country is Southern. People think they can just so publicly shit on us for something they know nothing about. Let me tell you something my family has been there for generations they had no slaves had to bust their asses having their children working hard picking cotton and corn using wood stoves until the damn 70s. Only the rich had slaves and that made up what 2% of our population ha. Bunch bullshit putting down an entire cultures heritage because of a few bad seeds that had the money and could call the shots.","post_message":"As the nation struggles with the legacy of a historic icon commonly brandished by hate groups, the outcome of that conversation could resonate in Oregon, too."},{"comment_id":"1576025939362143","commenter_b":"This is America not European dont like America go back to European take DONALD TRUMP with you ok gringo","commenter_a":"Why are people dumb enough to think people who do not want illegals in the US hate Mexicans? Or any other foreigner? It is ILLEGALS that they want to regulate, no those entering the country legally. We could do without the wall, just get more Border Patrol and more bullets...and do like other nations, shoot those crossing illegally, maybe that would satisfy the supporters of illegal immigration...

Wake up you ignorant fool!","commenter_a":"If you are a woman who is offended by what Donald Trump said a decade ago but you enjoyed 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and other movies and books like this than you are a hypocrite! Do you laugh when comedians talk like this or do you stand up and leave the room!?! I was not offended, I could care less what he said BS's with men in private - give me a break! I care about what he says and does now - I care about what he will do for our country! Look what Hillary did that mainstream media is covering up - her speeched released show she also refers to people as bucket of losers....has two different policies, one for public,one for private...not to mention the entire email scandal with her 'innocent' friends all getting immunity...why do innocent people needimmunity?","post_message":"After audio was released of Donald J.
