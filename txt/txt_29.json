That would be the mature thing to do here. You can't just use the serious topic of misogyny and sexism as an argument whenever you like. It plays a great disservice to the genuine areas where such a discourse is absolutely valid. This is about holding a proven heavily corrupted, belligerent war-mongerer to account, who happens to be a woman. End of story.","commenter_a":"Sorry Guardian, but no one actually buys the 'its because she's a woman' argument when it comes to Clinton. There are actually legitimate reasons why many do not like her. You're wasting your time.","post_message":"\"Hillary Clinton irritates people not just because of her gender, but because we simply can’t process her narrative. There are no stories that prepare us for her trajectory through life and, therefore, we react to her as if she’s a disruption in our reality, rather than a person. We love public women best when they are losers, when they’re humiliated, defeated, or (in some instances) just plain killed. Yet Clinton, despite the disapproval that rains down on her, continues to go out there and chalk up wins.\""},{"comment_id":"905141892877096","commenter_b":"You are a gruberized voter.","commenter_a":"Based on the polling from this thread Roy should keep his money and not bother to get re-elected. @webpagelink","post_message":"Missouri was one of the first states in the nation to reject President Obama’s fundamentally flawed health care law. For the past five years, I’ve heard from countless Missouri workers, seniors, and families who are facing higher costs and fewer choices due to the president’s health care take-over. As we mark the 5th anniversary of #ObamaCare becoming law today, I’m still fighting to repeal this flawed law and replace it with common-sense health care solutions."},{"comment_id":"10152948923481336","commenter_b":"Generale brazilian lord me brazilian","commenter_a":"Angel Diaz Stacey Diaz @username Tom Tom Sheppard","post_message":"A breathtaking photo from the U.S. Navy shows a rainbow over the bow of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS John C.
