A change is coming in American politics, and even Hillary Clinton won't be able to stop it. Delay it, maybe, but the majority of the American people from all sides have had enough with business as usual at their expense and are mad as hell about it. Just look at the long lines at the polls and the huge turnouts at Bernie Sanders' rallies if there are any doubts - that is the beginning of the revolution which Sanders is talking about.","post_message":"Left enough already?"},{"comment_id":"10153208513188812","commenter_b":"WWF on wheels....","commenter_a":"He should b able to race it wasn't his fault his car got stolen they should make an acceptation","post_message":"UPDATE: Police find stolen NASCAR Sprint Cup race car: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153434092834586","commenter_b":"First let's remove these beautiful creatures from these ugly hateful humans, then hook them up to the carriages to earn money.
