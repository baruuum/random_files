Yesterday a Texas court struck down the US Chamber of Commerce’s attempt to overturn a new Labor Department rule requiring retirement advisers to put their customers’ interests first. The decision affirms what we already knew: this conflict of interest rule was lawfully enacted and the rulemaking process took the views, costs, and benefits of all the stakeholders into account. Now President Trump needs to follow suit. He should stand up to the Chamber of Commerce — and the armies of lawyers and lobbyists that brought this frivolous lawsuit — and allow the rule to be implemented in April as planned.  Hardworking Americans saving for their retirement deserve to have a retirement adviser who is recommending the investments that are the best for their retirement security, not the ones that let advisers pocket kickbacks and prizes."},{"comment_id":"1286179581424362","commenter_b":"And she is a liar and murder!","commenter_a":"He can talk about Hillary all day, but he has no real plan for this country, he's an imbecile.","post_message":"REPLAY: Donald Trump at a rally in Wilmington, Ohio."},{"comment_id":"10153923556708690","commenter_b":"they will unfortunately forever be in western countries, untill all western countries are taken-over by muslims, because western countries have welfare system, none of the arab countries have a social welfare system like western people... so only when social welfare is completely destroyed like in sweden, they will have to get back to survive..
