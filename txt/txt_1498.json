For me, I don't want kids and that is unacceptable to so many people. She only wanted one and that was JUST AS UNACCEPTABLE! We know what we want our families to look like. Trust us, we're women!","commenter_a":"I respect your decision to not have kids. Some people don't. It's an important job that should only be done by people who want you. BUT, I think making a decision like that at 28 years old was a little rash. A lot of things change. I had my daughter when I was 39 years old. Things that make you happy in your 20's are not necessarily going to be the same for the rest of your life. And, don't be sad for people who tell you that there is no greater love than one for a child. There isn't!! Don't knock it just because you don't understand.","post_message":"“What I want is to be happy.”"},{"comment_id":"785245424951309","commenter_b":"Girl go sit down somewhere","commenter_a":"those that vote for the \"first female\" president will get the same crap that the \"first black\" man president gave us.","post_message":"President Obama is speaking at a \"Get Out The Vote\" rally in Ann Arbor.
