If you think outside the subjugated status quo box where you live it is possible to allocate the economic resources where we want it to be instead of for example spending trillions on wars and then passing a debt bill to we the people so we paid more to wall street. Simple enough. We can even pass legislation specifying since that Iraq war was illegal due to lies for greed we can write off that illegal debt and don't paid to wall street. Hmm just brain storming the possibilities once we change the Congress, Senate, and Bernie is our POTUS. Just follow THE PANAMA PAPERS.","commenter_a":"Hillary is Cynical.
