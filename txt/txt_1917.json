Perhaps the NFL should start requiring artists to submit song choices & performance videos ahead of time for approval or better yet just have a military or top-ranked college marching band perform.","commenter_a":"She's disgusting and an embarrassment to the entire country. The Superbowl was not the place for a political statement and someone at the NFL should be held responsible for her selection. She degraded the event and insulted the vast majority of Americans who chose to watch. I for one did not.","post_message":"Buckle up, 'cuz Rudy's got something to say...."},{"comment_id":"675876952588617","commenter_b":"Hillary is a lying bitch.","commenter_a":"Won't hear this at the debate.","post_message":"JUST IN!"},{"comment_id":"1089590774419709","commenter_b":"The most stupid people in America are and has been those always vote against their own economical interests.

Trump may not be perfect but at least he's not selling out to the ones trying to take away our Christian beliefs.he wants Christian morals back in our schools and families and I don't care about the rest. God will handle the rest. If Hillary gets in you better learn Sharia law because shes already sold out.
