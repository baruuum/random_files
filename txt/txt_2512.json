Lots of parents I know say they prefer the class donation as they may not always get a chance to shop or might not know the child well enough to personalise the gift.","commenter_a":"Let me put forth a different perspective: my kids are in classes with 20 odd children in - this is excluding family and family friends who attend the parties. At birthdays if all the class kids attend that's 20 gifts. You are hard pressed to find something cheaper than 10 quid these days and most individual presents cost more so if everyone gives 10 quid it lands up being more affordable for a lot of people, means a lot less clutter in what are often small London homes or apartments, and collectively with say 200 pounds a child can get one substantial gift like a bike or it could go towards something the parents need for their child. I genuinely don't see an issue with this at all and fail to see how this is a middle class issue.","post_message":"Oh, dear. // BuzzFeed UK"},{"comment_id":"10153438703061130","commenter_b":"A FEMINIST is for EVERYONE.","commenter_a":"this woman is a complete poser. she does not stand with all women. just ask conservative women orgs","post_message":"\"Saying something is almost always better than swallowing it and then thinking about it for two days.\""},{"comment_id":"890231291031876","commenter_b":"Why would you slap immigrants in the face by rewarding those that broke the law?","commenter_a":"There are a lot of academic papers (i.e. data by experts and not angry, ignorant people on Facebook) that shows that 1) undocumented residents have a MUCH smaller drain on tax dollars relative to what they contribute than what the media hypes up (generating fear is a lot faster/easier/profitable than actually knowing the facts), 2) that immigrants rank high on civic service, 3) that immigrants rank high on starting new businesses ventures, 4) that the U.S. Immigrantion system shows indicators of being purposefully designed to have an undocumented work force for which the govt. can reap benefits without paying the full bundle of rights, etc.","post_message":"We must sign comprehensive immigration reform into law to bring over 11 million undocumented workers out of the shadows.
