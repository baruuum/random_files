It is very raciest of you to assume only Hispanics are illegal and most legal Hispanics would like illegals deported. We have immigration laws in this country and they will be enforced .You are nothing but a hateful bigot. Eva's country doesn't deal with an illegal immigration problem because they strictly enforce their immigration laws; as soon as Canada takes in 10 million illegals Eva can have an opinion on this matter.","commenter_a":"Trump stirred it up with all his comments during the campaign. He brought out the worst in people. And because he was so verbal againgst race...religions...women...all the racist bigots who kept semi silent for a while have come outta of the woodwork and guess who led the way. And to think he is now going to be the leader of your country.","post_message":"Chili's provides veterans a free meal every Veterans Day, so US Army veteran Ernest Walker went to his local Chili's for a burger.

We definitely don't want them here in the US we have enough dealing with illegals coming from our southern border...!","commenter_a":"Take 30 seconds to sign (and possibly share) this petition asking the US government to take in 65000 Syrian refugees. Germany is expected to accept 800,000 refugees this year, while the US has accepted less than 1,000 thus far. Let's do a small part to encourage the U.S. government to be socially responsible. This is a humanitarian crisis and the Syrian refugees have nowhere to go. You can vote no matter where you are from. @webpagelink","post_message":"\"The world sees Germany as a country of hope and chances,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a news conference last week.
