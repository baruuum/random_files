Killers should know that gas chamber is their end. But when the law starts making up excuses for their actions, every law goes out the window. Illegals guns hit the streets because its about money. When someone chooses to be stupid, is not about money, the culprit list will be long, and everybody should be hold accountable. So, should we shot everybody and ask later? There are some people who are paying the consequences for not thinking ahead, trying to uphold the laws in their hands, like some kind of hero. What exactly is a THUG? and what exactly is a GOOD person?","commenter_a":"Screw the 2nd ammendment, this clowns can not handle this right.

Despite Trump's assertions that he was going to stand up for working people it turns out that Wall Street and Goldman Sachs are still running the show - and the Trump administration. Among many other billionaires in the Trump administration is Gary D. Cohn, the departing president of Goldman Sachs and Trump's new director of the National Economic Council. Upon leaving Goldman Sachs, Cohn just received an exit package of $285 million. Yes, $285 million.  And that's how the rigged economy and oligarchy works. The middle class of this country bailed out Goldman Sachs to the tune of over $800 billion. Goldman Sachs paid a $5 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury for illegal activity, as did virtually every other major bank. Meanwhile, no top Wall Street executive is prosecuted for criminal activity. Instead, the president of Goldman Sachs becomes the leading financial adviser to the President. And, to add insult to injury, Cohn and the Trump administration will soon end up supporting huge tax breaks for the rich while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Can we stop them? Yes. But only through a powerful and focused grassroots movement which tells Congress to represent us all, not just the 1 percent."},{"comment_id":"1532037343754150","commenter_b":"Forcing an innocent girl to say sorry to China due to afraid of losing a large profit. Good job Communist China and JYPE!! And if Taiwan and Communist China are the same state. Why Taiwan has her own flag, currency, army and diplomacy? And why does her people have the universal suffrage to vote to elect her own president? Why those chinese doesn't have the right to elect their leader directly? A \"small\" state like Taiwan has so many political parties. And A Big China just rule by Communist Party. How good to see democracy and dictatorship really works in!
