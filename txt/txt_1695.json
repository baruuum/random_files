Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim. 2. Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump without being able to win at the negotiating table. 3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don need a policy expert or a legislator we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale. 4. Trump is a man who tells the truth.

Conservatives claiming the Pope is pro-gay, pro-abortion, anti-marriage, blah,blah. The Pope has never said he agrees with those things, he has said it's not his place to judge others who have that life style. Just like Jesus would do today. He loves everyone without reservation. Something sorely lacking in today's society.","post_message":"Pope Francis says addressing climate change `can no longer be left to a future generation'"}]
