Not only did 50% of all California driver's licenses go to illegal aliens, but they have motor voter laws so those illegals are now eligible to vote even though they are not citizens. Non-citizen should NEVER be allowed to vote and neither should welfare recipients who have been on welfare for more than two years. They should not be allowed to vote on how the money from tax payers is spent when they are not paying taxes themselves.","post_message":"Did you know HALF of all California driverâ€™s licenses issued in 2015 went to illegal aliens?"},{"comment_id":"1297459886999211","commenter_b":"People, people, people, ain't nothing going to happen to this horrible, discussing bitch ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±","commenter_a":"Nasty woman.","post_message":"It's called \"Orgy Island,\" and there was already evidence linking Bill Clinton to it.

So you can't be \"successful\" without birth control? Women can't be successful if they become mothers? Women can't be successful unless they're childless? This modern feminist movement is ridiculous. It tells women they can't have a life if they have kids. True feminism teaches that women can do anything they set their minds to because they are strong and capable. And another thing, Miss Lawerence. You have access to condoms and birth control through many other outlets that do not kill innocent children for profit. It is delusional to believe otherwise.","post_message":"Hunger Games Actress Jennifer Lawrence: Thanks to Planned Parenthood Iâ€™m a Successful Woman"},{"comment_id":"10152731683061234","commenter_b":"Hey Mary...
