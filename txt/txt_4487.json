But I work at a restaurant down the street from the county sheriff's department, and the boys in blue that come in are often disrespectful and rude, and act entitled to walk all over us because they're cops. They once refused to leave after we closed, even though they were done eating. I'll start respecting the blue more when the good ones start publicly, and loudly denouncing the ones who aren't.","post_message":"This officer had just finished a nice meal and was preparing to pay his bill when he noticed something written on the receipt."},{"comment_id":"10152895452606051","commenter_b":"BANG!

In the 90s, the extreme right-wing Republikaner and the DVU gained in support because of this blind open-door policy. What is more, Germany expects other EU countries to do the same, irrespective of the cost. I say that this has to stop.","commenter_a":"The Germans typically let in loads of war refugees. More than they can handle. It's their way of apologising for World Wars 1 and 2. In the 90s, they let in 320,000 war refugees from Yugoslavia. What happened in German towns ? Property rents skyrocketed and the crime rates went right up. What's worse, the Germans expect every other country to do the same. Whacky open-door immigration. The UK needs to leave the EU, get sovereignty over its borders and immigration / refugee legisation back and tackle the problem as a single nation. This time, the Germans are letting in 800,000 war refugees from Syria. Absolutely crazy.","post_message":"Ever since Angela Merkel took the lead on the migrant crisis, critics began speaking as though she created it. This is nonsense"}]
