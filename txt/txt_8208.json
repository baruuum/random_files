The major reason was that 70% of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction under six years of the Obama administration. The WSJ Editorial Democrats vs. the Middle Class shows the devastating impact of Obama and Democratic Party progressive policies over the last five years on the middle and lower income class. Progressive Policies buy votes, but destroy prosperity. Anybody with incomes less than $70,000 has been devastated with losses of around 6% to 8% while inflation lowers buying power. @webpagelink","commenter_a":" 12-Step Program for Recovering Democrats is a WSJ Editorial to help Democrats make a recovery from the shock of the last election.
