Problem is that people are so selfish, narcissistic, and apathetic that they don't really LOOK at a person until its too late. Did I mention lazy? Handle problems on the front end and there will be less on the back end. Do you want to elect Carly Fiorina? Or a woman with multiple murders under her belt? Or a hatemongerer?
