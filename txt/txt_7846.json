There is nothing whatsoever \"OK\" about killing an unborn baby and justifying it as \"a woman's choice\". Women's rights and women's health issues have nothing to do with killing a baby. Albeit legal, it's a complete disgrace. But you're right - no tax monies should support it!","post_message":"Abortion is legal, but taxpayers shouldnâ€™t have to pay for it. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10155086722556323","commenter_b":"@username Will it be a big, beautiful wall?","commenter_a":"I can see the 'Jungle' camps with the immigrants around the NI border already :)","post_message":"Ireland prime minister has warned that avoiding a post-Brexit border is now vital for the republic national interest."},{"comment_id":"10153617533472061","commenter_b":"She's shark bait!","commenter_a":"@username did u see this yet?

Who marked that mail in ballot? Who is at the keyboard for online voting? Do you have a repeatable count of the votes? Again, voting in person with ID with paper ballot.","commenter_a":"Voting should be the same in every state, county, city, town, whatever. Mail in ballots should be available to everyone. I think eventually we should go to online voting if we can keep the republicans from tampering with it.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154038278856990","commenter_b":"My prayers and condolences for the family.

It demands that women be covered from the top of their heads to their toes. HOW STUPID is that. But this is just a small portion of the TORTURE. We are America. We will NOT HAVE SHARIAH LAW.
