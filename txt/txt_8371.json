Islam Permits Lying to Deceive Unbelievers and Bring World Domination! Muslims lie when it is in their interest to do so and will not hold them accountable for lying when it is beneficial to the cause of Islam. They can lie without any guilt or fear of accountability or retribution.

He is simply making a point that she is a privileged elite who lives by one standard of protection and expects the little people--the unworthy stupid masses--to try and survive under a different one. It's called irony. To deliberately misinterpret and inflame his message (as a call to 'assassination'???!!!) is just proving Hillary right--her sheeple are the stupid masses.
