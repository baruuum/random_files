The number ending up at Calais is miniscule, the article also states most don't even know about our benefit system so maybe we left behind a massive impression after colonising half the world they figure we are the country they admire or can relate to, to be honest i don't care, if its they live or die then they should live here","commenter_a":"Those people in calais are not true refugees or asylum seekers, if they where, they would claim fir asylum in france. EU law says that they should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Last time I checked, france is a safe country, so is spain, italy, germany, and many other eu countries. What I don't understand is why there are over 5,000 of these so called asylum seekers camping in calais trying to get into the uk. If you are a genuine asylum seeker, you don't get to pick and choose where you want to live.","post_message":"When youâ€™re facing the worldâ€™s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, it helps to have a sober debate about how to respond. But to do that, you need facts and data â€“ two things that the British migration debate has lacked this summer.  These, in the clearest terms, are the 10 key facts."},{"comment_id":"952513631455776","commenter_b":"No big deal. Mrs Bush did the same thing.","commenter_a":"Why is it so outrageous that an American woman does not do unculturally American things? Why is it that anything the President and his wife do so politically charged and subject to the idle chatter of people who have no interests outside of demeaning and denigrating people who are doing their level best for this country and its citizens? When you demean the President and his wife, you make us all small, meaner people, and this country seen as acollection of barbarians and yokels.","post_message":"How do you feel about Michelle Obama not wearing a headscarf while visiting Saudi Arabia?"},{"comment_id":"10153865270269749","commenter_b":"Gillian..you too are vermin! We must make sure that you do not breed indiscriminately!","commenter_a":"Foxes are vermin and very distructive for farmers, not the cuddly toys as always portrayed by the media. However what is the most humane way to cull them.. A bullet is best but only if you are a very good shot as a wounded fox can take days to die. Poisoning is also a slow death. Trapping is just as bad as they can take days to die or try and chew off their own paws. So it looks like there is no easy answer, and no we cannot just let them breed indiscriminately without some control as you would understand if you saw the havoc they can cause especially in the lambing season.","post_message":"'Fox hunting is a pursuit from the past and like the overwhelming majority of the population I believe that is where it should stay, consigned to history.'"},{"comment_id":"1851225291776966","commenter_b":"well said ,","commenter_a":"Trump's Victory, in another term (American people's Victory) has proven that the good citizens of the USA are great at determining their future, and changing the game and the whole regime for a better living and even world because America has a big influence on the whole world. Despite the massive media war that had been trying and pushing hard to find a way to put Mr. Trump aside or down to fail him by any dirty politics, means and ways... BUT they couldn't do you know why? Because he is capable and honest and most of all I believe that the church of humble believers everywhere have had an input in this victory asking the Good Father for this amazing nation to shine His face upon America again as He did in the past...!","post_message":"Former President George W.
