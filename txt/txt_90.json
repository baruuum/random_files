You have no idea what her function at Walmart even is yet you make this idiotic comment. Let me guess, you hate YOUR job and so have this need to crap on others? Her simple point was that it's a myth that all Walmart employees are on or qualify for foodstamps. Keep on hating and being ignorant!","commenter_a":"I have worked at walmart for ten years. I don't even qualify for wic because I make too much money! And with my first baby on the way I could have used the assistance. Not every single walmart employee is on food stamps. Oh and I also bought a house, got a nice car, all while working there....crazy","post_message":"That's a one cent difference, folks. Only *one* cent.

You are still avoiding what you are going to do with the illegals that aren't criminals. Actually they did break the law if they came here illegally and if they stay here even if they don't get citizenship it's still ammnesty. You need to be up front with what you are going to do.","commenter_a":"Great speech!!!!","post_message":"Thank you for your wonderful support last night- with regard to my Immigration Speech that I delivered at the Phoenix Convention Center.
