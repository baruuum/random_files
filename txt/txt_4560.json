She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream.

CEA finds what economists would call “increasing marginal costs” of delay. If we don’t make a concerted effort to keep the rise in average global temperature within the range consistent with modest costs and instead allow it to stabilize one degree Celsius higher, the annual additional damages would equal 0.9 percent of global output. A longer delay that added another degree would cause additional annual damages of 1.2 percent of global output. That’s a total change of 2.1 percentage points. To illustrate those annual costs more tangibly, 2.1 percent of current U.S. GDP, which is about a fifth of world output, is roughly $360 billion. The story doesn’t end there, however. There’s a lot of uncertainty around these estimates. Acting sooner rather than later is insurance against unpleasant surprises.
