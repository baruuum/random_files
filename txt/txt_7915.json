I was trying NOT to be cynical, but was wondering, if you hust had dinner with your wife, and you're entering an elevator, what possible reason do you have to unholster your weapon?

Officer Darryl Jouett removed his gun from its holster and was apparently trying to put it in his pocket when it went off. A bullet ricocheted off the elevator door and hit him in the stomach. Jouett on Monday told WCPO - 9 On Your Side he was at home and on the mend.
