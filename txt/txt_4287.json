People who are so close minded that they can't see out their \"perfect little bubble\" and judge anyone and everyone different than them. I love my generation because we are some accepting individuals. We want equality for all because WE ARE ALL HUMAN!! why does it matter to YOU personally what genitals someone has/wants. Who they lay down with behind closed doors. Why is considered \"crazy\" for the parents to support THEIR child's dreams and aspirations. Like got damn lady. Worry about your own snatch and keep your negativity to yourself. ‚úåüíö","commenter_a":"Wow that family needs serious psychiatric help.","post_message":"\"By four, Samuel broke out in hives when we tried to cut his hair, and at five he told us, through tears, that he wanted to burn his face off because it wasn a girl face.\""},{"comment_id":"1063405993707262","commenter_b":"@username by sitting this election out, you will be voting for Hillary!","commenter_a":"The Donald has his whole family there. Oh, and his favorite adviser - himself, his biggest fan - himself, his biggest fan - himself. Who else does he need? He's been saying all along that he will win without support. The truth is that, as much as I dislike these guys, they are basing this on principles. Laura, I used to have much more trust in you, but you've gone over too the dark side it seems. Trump is the worst candidate in my lifetime. And when you consider that includes Dole, McCain, Romney and the Bushes, that's saying a lot.","post_message":"Jeb Bush, John Kasich and company reveal they value their egos more than the GOP's success."},{"comment_id":"10154341575671729","commenter_b":"Not a charge will be brought against this bitch","commenter_a":"How much worse does it have to get?

This bill is not the answer to a difficult problem. Some of the folks that have posted think this is a great bill. They aren't stopping to realize that it will cost more to house, feed, and send these people back to wherever they have come from, which is probably a very unsafe place or why would they have left in the first place? I hope this bill is seen for what it is, a terrible step in the wrong direction and hopefully our Senators will have more sense than to pass it into law. If you will check the numbers, in recent years more undocumented people have left the United States than have entered.","post_message":"The vile legislation that is now before the Senate might as well be called the \"Donald Trump Act.\" Like the disgusting and outrageous language championed by Donald Trump, this legislation paints all immigrants as ‚Äúcriminals and rapists.‚Äù Local law enforcement officials, domestic violence groups, immigrants‚Äô rights groups, mayors, faith leaders and labor groups all oppose the \"Donald Trump Act.\" This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe, and it certainly does nothing to address our broken immigration system."},{"comment_id":"1528186400555160","commenter_b":"Thank you!","commenter_a":"THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS is more basic to the RIGHTS of Americans than; the right to bear arms to defend. When the constitution was written it took two conventions to come up with ten amendments, BUT the first amendment was the same not changed and was readily adopted as others were still being picked and discussed.
