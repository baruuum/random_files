Again libtards are so out of touch with reality its scary, you all hate this country and the constitution but yet none of you have lived in anoyher country to compare. Like I said, try living in China or Cuba, or Greece, or Russia if you all think big government and socialism are so great. Btw, name calling and insults mean nothing.","commenter_a":"To the guy with \"the america was never great\" sign, why don't you go live in another country for awhile and then come back and waive that sign. Scary how delusional some people are.","post_message":"Music, signs and lots of confrontation between Trump protesters and rally attendees in Prescott Valley. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153052525021748","commenter_b":"Does she know how many Muslims Obama kills every day?","commenter_a":"She's really losing it.","post_message":"\"Muslims would like to take over the world and establish their caliphate, and Obama has let so many Muslims in.\""},{"comment_id":"1729670857287408","commenter_b":"HILLARY CLINTON YOUR HONEST, LOVING, CARING CANDIDATE! @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Be patient my precious.

They want to provide State-finder childcare, too? And, preschool? Every study I read says the current system of young elementary school is failing kids (too much time in seats, not enough art and play, etc.) and the solution is to start them even earlier? Free childcare, free preschool, free K-12, and Bernie wants free college. Where does it end?","post_message":"The goal: free preschool and affordable daycare for all."},{"comment_id":"1117284038339327","commenter_b":"Please don't.
