Why? Because leadership matters. It matters if we want to restore America's role in the world, find the political will to take on the entrenched special interests that continually stand in the way of fundamental change, reform entitlement spending at every level of government, and ensure that every child, no matter their zip code, has access to a quality education. So, today I am announcing the launch of the Leadership Matters for America PAC. The PAC's goal to get real leadership back in our country starts today. So, let's get to work!

There are cruel rich doctors out there who would pay the cops for good amount of money to keep their business running. Money ruins everything.. 55 years is too much. Child rapist should spend 55 years, not marijuana sellers. People sell drugs to provide for their families. Not everyone do it to get rich for themselves. Low income families has it harder when providing family because of health issues.. Some marijuana sellers could be good people too, it is just unfair to put them in jail for 55 years. How ironic that McDonald and other fast food chain restaurants sells junk food that can harm a lot of people while marijuana harms less people...
