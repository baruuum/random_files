The terror experienced in Paris for one night is what they go through on a day to day basis and you want to send them away? Have some empathy, what if it was you and your child fleeing this barbarism? Turning them away is no better than away Jewish refugees during WW2 (see SS St. Louis). How anyone can see their suffering and simply ignore it or tell them to leave defies any and all tenants of a Christian faith, humanity, and what America stands for.","post_message":"How very Christian of them."},{"comment_id":"10153630304246509","commenter_b":"Guess you've never heard of Irish-American clubs. Guess you've never heard of Italian-American, German-American, Polish-American or perhaps people celebrating their ethnic heritage. So apparently pride in one's ethnic origins is not extended to Black Americans. What is the name Rush? English? I'm betting someone in your family came over on the Mayflower? Proud of that? Why not? Apparently if you were taken against your will in irons on a slave ship you also lose your ability to take pride in your heritage as well?","commenter_a":"There is no such place as \"Africa-America\" therefore there is no such thing as an \"African-American\". They are either Americans or they are Africans. Not all blacks come from Africa and not all Africans are black. Why don't they try and be American's for once in their life's?","post_message":"After recording an ode to Baltimore, #Prince has announced a Mother's Day rally and concert there.
