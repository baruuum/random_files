A presidential declaration is not necessary for every death that occurs unless it is someone who has national level. A state or city can lower the flags without a presidential declaration. People need to inform themselves about the flag lowering issues. If we lowered the flag for every person that got killed, the flag would never be flown at full staff.","post_message":"Former U.S. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell pleads on his Facebook page, 'Think on it.
