Both men and women are equally capable of cheating on their partners, so please The Huffington Post drop the \"all men are evil\" act and think before you type!","post_message":"“Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...\" Ashley Madison"},{"comment_id":"10157199868050354","commenter_b":"THE WALL, THE WALL, THE WALL........TRUMP 2016 !!!","commenter_a":"To our Canadian friends and partners.
