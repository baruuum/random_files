In the past ten days, the Trump Campaign joined the KKK, sucker-punched a Bernie supporter, attacked peaceful protestors, abandoned NATO, exported nuclear weapons to Japan and South Korea, spilled-the-beans on Heidi Cruz, outted Ted Cruz in a sex scandal, beat-up a female reporter, dropped nukes on Europe and the Middle East, and punished women for having abortions. These acts would be incomprehensible were it not for the fact that Donald Trump hates Mexicans, hates our trading partners, hates our stupid leaders, hates Muslims, hates women, hates blacks, hates reporters and Bernie supporters, and hates women having abortions. How can he claim to want to Make America Great Again, when he so clearly - hates Americans? There is no answer. Unless we look to the words of the candidate himself. According to The Donald: 1) He disavowed KKK David Duke endorsement; 2) He didn mind a ...","post_message":"There are a couple of twists in the story of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, accused of misdemeanor battery for allegedly grabbing the wrist of former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields.  He was not arrested as some outlets initially reported, but voluntarily signed a “notice to appear,” a misdemeanor summons.  And an anonymous Secret Service agent on Trump’s detail claims that what Fields did could have easily resulted in a much harsher response.

To be sanctified means to live a life separated from sin.. that's not a denomination either. .. sounds to me that teaching through love and kindness is in order.. people seem to fear what they don't understand. . To call her names and disrespect her by leaving her in a dark church is not right and does not reflect Holy living . They need to repent of that.. always respect your elders regardless. .. but also remember .. just because your old does not mean you know all the way of the Lord... no one does.. that's why we ...","post_message":"A 103-year-old Georgia woman was banned from the Elberton church she’s served for 92 years after she voiced concerns about the pastor’s sermons.  After ignoring the ban and attending church the weeks after getting the letter, the pastor dismissed the service and left her sitting in the pew with the lights off. Police were notified, but refused to throw a 103-year-old woman out of church.   She was also subjected to slurs from their former fellow churchgoers. MORE ----->  @webpagelink"}]
