Maybe a younger person follows what is 'the done thing' but with age and life experience, I think women just do what they want!","commenter_a":"It's just like the shaved pubes issue - all the same arguments. 'I do it for myself' etc etc. Look, virtually no young women shaved their pubes before porn videos made men expect it. And virtually no older women dyed their hair before looking our age became unacceptable.

I don't believe that building a wall will solve our immigration problems and banning the immigration of Muslims into the United States is unconstitutional. The First Amendment states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Banning Muslims from entering this nation goes against the beliefs of what our founding fathers envisioned for this nation.
