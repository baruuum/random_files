Labels are so 90s. I support Bernie because of his integrity, his consistency and his sincerity. I see none of those qualities in Hillary. I see the opposite in Hillary. I support Bernie because of his policies. Hillary uses too many weasel words when she talks about policy.

America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe.
