Apparently, we're not much to be concerned about. To my mind she's a big pile of ***t,...bring your own shovel. No need to place her in an urn or other bucket-like container, just toss it in with the other compost and let her continue to decompose.","commenter_a":"I've seen a number of articles on 'alternative' news sites claiming wikileaks is falsifying all this stuff. Kind of sad that people would go so far to bury their heads in the sand rather than even consider the thought that a candidate which rigged a primary is capable of so much more. #HillaryforPrison","post_message":"The sheer number of insults in the email trove has left the Clinton campaign unable or unwilling to respond."},{"comment_id":"1692664807687298","commenter_b":"She is evil...completely stupid","commenter_a":"She needs help that was sick","post_message":"This is SICK!

At first it seemed a bit strange to me, then I thought 'Oh well, if a 60 year old can do that, I can, too'. That was when I stopped caring. As for underpants, not enough fabric, so I'll pass.","commenter_a":"Stupid debate. Why should it bother me how people sunbathe? I don't care if they are dressed, half naked or naked. Let everyone do what they are comfortable doing, it's not like you have to look.","post_message":"â€œIt all depends on what type of underwear it is. If they had an Ann Summers crotchless type affair then that would be a touch odd.'"}]
