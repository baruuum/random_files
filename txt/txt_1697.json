Most vile, lieing, thieving, corrupt witch on the planet!","commenter_a":"She lied and lied and has lied about her lies, all the while breaking the law, and half America still thinks she should be president. I would as soon a bank robber or one who had commited treason be president. Her lawbreaking and lying has been such a lifestyle for so long I can't imagine her being president no matter what skunk is running against her.","post_message":"An iconic photograph of Hillary Clinton using her BlackBerry while wearing sunglasses on a military plane prompted an official in her office to inquire about whether Clinton had been assigned a government email address...  The information came out in sworn testimony in a Judicial Watch deposition of Karin Lang, a former State Department official.

They should use their brains!!!!","commenter_a":"Feeding your baby and using your body the way God intended it to be used is absolutely shameful. How on earth could women stand up for such a thing and demand that society accept this!","post_message":"Women are brilliantly standing up to breast-feed shaming.

There are no voter suppression laws. Requiring an id is not voter suppression.","commenter_a":"Where was all your outrage over the treasonous Clinton pay for play entanglements?

Guess what? Those antibiotics are transferred to humans who eat meat and cause cancers in humans. Be safe, don't eat meat or during dairy milk.","commenter_a":"Why? Wouldn't this be a conflict of interest? It behooves hospitals to feed their patients meat with as many antibiotics as possible so people would visit again in the future and hopefully for a much longer stay.","post_message":"Hospitals are on the front lines of the battle against antibiotic resistance."},{"comment_id":"10153389153527169","commenter_b":"Don't despair. I have a niece named Gretchen. You are not alone! ;)","commenter_a":"Try being a Gretchen. I was literally the only one in my entire school all through k-12.
