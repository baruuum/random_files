Same old narrow-mindedness and folks being too lazy to do ACTUAL research. Some people are so close-minded that even if you had the proof right in front of their face, they wouldn't believe it.

We MUST stop them NOW!!!!' *SMDH* Heaven forbid that they actually admit that PP provides other things to both women AND men as far as health screenings, treatment and counseling. So go ahead you Fools, and defund a program that low-income families have depended on for years. I just don't understand how some folks call themselves 'Christians'.","post_message":"Planned Parenthood says Medicaid patients have a right to choose their health care provider.
