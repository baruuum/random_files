Abortions, especially late term abortions are cruel and inhumane!","commenter_a":"It's planned parent hood they do a lot more then abortions. And @username women chose well some prolly forced so @username women got knocked up because they didn't practice safe sex. I thought women wanted the right to chose what they do with there bodies planned parent hood also helps with women's health who can't afford insurance or hospitals the government cut there funding right? So how can they help these people and if they closed right now you don't think @username people won't find someone else to do abortions.
