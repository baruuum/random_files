The only money that gets printed is money that gets destroyed that banks send back. We are not in debt because we keep printing our own money. We can only print as much money as we have in our gold reserves. The reason we are in debt is because we keep borrowing money from places like China. But see that's the problem with the people in this country, they run to the polls to vote but have no clue how anything even operates","commenter_a":"Trump won't be any better. We will have more wars and more debt. Your pensions and other government ensured money will be gambled away again. The dollar will continue to devalue as the Fed prints money debt money. More American jobs will go overseas to China and Mexico. The middle class will slowly but surely wither away while people wonder what happened AGAIN and do absolutely nothing but complain on the couch or internet. The list goes on and on and on but you reap what you sew I guess. It is always the younger generation who has to clean up the mess of the old as always.","post_message":"Donald J. Trump just ripped apart Obama's Iran deal with 6 blunt words that hit home to millions of Americans.

There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems. HRC cannot denounce Fracking. Now, before you think that article that spells out how much HRC is taking in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry is another Republican smear tactic, note that it is by Greenpeace. She has to go. ...","post_message":"\"We can open the door to every person in this country again.\" ‚ÄîPresident Bill Clinton"}]
