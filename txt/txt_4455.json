The Marine Corps did numerous studies that show infantry units became much less effective when women were added. Currently, a special forces Sgt. is being court martialed and will be less than honorably discharged because he confronted an Afgan police officer and pushed him to the ground because he was ongoingly raping a little boy- that's a good thing? Our veterans are literally dying because they are having to wait for treatment from the VA - that's a good thing? A lot of great officers are being let go and forced out because they don't agree with Obama's policy's....that's a good thing? The current ROE's tie soldiers hands and put them in danger. The morale is at an all time low....things are not good. THis plus ...","commenter_a":"Our military is second to none!
