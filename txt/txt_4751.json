Anyone who doesn't want to stand for our national anthem on game day should be kicked from the league.

Wake up people, he is setting you up, playing you like a fiddle for his own political agenda. What a low life to use the children over and over. Not one damn thing he is going to use that damn pen for, will stop the issues we have. The gun doesn't pull its own trigger and mentally ill, terrorists, and murderers do not obey damn laws. He wants to disarm the law abiding. Ask him to dismiss the secret service that carry guns to protect his ass and see how far you get.","post_message":"“Every time I think about those kids [in Newtown], it gets me mad,” President Barack Obama said as tears rolled down his cheek.
