These premeditated murders were likely politically motivated acts of terrorism. This is the same stuff we saw when the American left attempted to impose their will on peace loving citizens through bombings, political assassinations, physical attacks on returning service members, and violent protests back during the 1960s. For those of us who were children at the time, watching this stuff on the nightly news became indelibly burned into our psyche. It was a scary time for our country.

Giseleangelique D, 47, of Thousand Oaks allegedly sought out young mothers under the guise of a charitable organization looking for women with 1 to 2-month-old infants to assist.  That's how D found Eliza Delacruz, police say. She allegedly stalked the infant's mother and then had a co-conspirator snatch the child. Three other people were also arrested in the alleged plot, which includes an attack on another mother and child in El Segundo.   What investigators say they can't figure out is why 3-week-old Eliza was killed.
