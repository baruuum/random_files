Look at the debt. Look how the 2nd amendment has been attacked. And our religious freedoms. What about the Isis.....we are walking away from the America I have known, and I am 78 yrs old,","commenter_a":"My husband and I are fine, but woe to my grand and great grandchildren in the years to come. They will never understand how truly great Ametica was, they will never know what freedom was...","post_message":"In November, Americans sent a clear message to Washington that they were tired of political gridlock and want solutions and real results to the problems facing our country. Both President Bush and President Clinton used their State of the Union address following difficult midterm elections to acknowledge that they no longer have control of both chambers and that it was time for them to work with Congress. Unfortunately, tonight was another missed opportunity for President Obama and his legacy.    President Obama used this evening to appease his political base and focused on dividing our Nation and using bureaucratic control to run our country with top-down Washington-centered solutions. I believe the key to growing a healthy economy begins by strengthening the paycheck of hard working Americans, putting more money into Kansans pockets, and growing our economy from the bottom-up.     While I was disappointed in many of the President's remarks, I remain hopeful there will be opportunities in the near future to work together to expand trade and fix our broken tax code. I remain hopeful that this President will seize those opportunities just as those who preceded him did."},{"comment_id":"10153921301277217","commenter_b":"'@username has lost their integrity!","commenter_a":"Hahaha.sorry for the laugh.

Since when is it 'crazy' to fight for freedom from a tyrannical government? They aren't trying to hurt anyone. They are wanting the ability to live free!! People are fined and jailed for living 'off the grid.' THIS IS WHAT WE CALL TYRANY PEOPLE!!! The constitution was created to help protect us from corrupt government... hence the ability to bear arms. This is why.
