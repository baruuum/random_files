Citizens of a nation( especially one a great as america) should not have to live in fear of police persecution. The whole police force needs reform. The dirty cops, racist cops and just dam right bad police officers need to go. If your a trigger happy racist peace of shit who hides behind a badge and a gun to only parade around saying your a protector of peace, you need to be weeded out.
