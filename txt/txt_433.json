Just goes to show you that living in a mansion in Beverly Hills, riding in chauffeured limos, traveling the world and having the best of everything, still doesn't make these people happy. Pitiful!","commenter_a":"Booob!!!","post_message":"BAHAHAHA!"},{"comment_id":"10153037985012377","commenter_b":"100% true. Politics is no longer about helping American people. To all these politicians it is PURLEY about personal gain and saying ANYTHING and doing ANYTHING for votes. I wonder why we can't fix our economy with millions and millions of illegals taking jobs and paying ZERO taxes. It's a travesty and a COMPLETE INJUSTICE to ACTUAL HARD WORKING AMERICANS!","commenter_a":"It's the dirty, lying, self-righteous, power hungry B Sers who allowed this Illegal Immigration to go on for political gains and votes. Migration laws continually are being broken by both parties to either gain or expand their political power. They could care less how it's affecting the American citizen tax payers, by costi g them Billions of dollars per year to feed them, send them to school, healthcare, and their babies born here become immediately American citizens. Trump in 2026 for POTUS, to eliminate this millstone around the neck of the tax payers.","post_message":"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe illegal immigration is a problem..."},{"comment_id":"10154162897758855","commenter_b":"@username I was fondled by an obnoxious straight woman at a bachelorette party at a gay bar. She would not stop. I grabbed her hands and she told me never to put my hands on a woman. She was thrown out of the bar","commenter_a":"What gay man would touch a woman's crotch and breasts..? That doesn't add up in the least... Also what about all the sexual harassment done by straight women to gay men? Are we going to completely ignore that?","post_message":"What role do gay men have in sexual harassment?"},{"comment_id":"10154093601280695","commenter_b":"Beautiful ladies","commenter_a":"People say the same about my mom.

It is against his plan for a Muslim takeover.","commenter_a":"Get started on the over-ride and start taking with the House to get this president impeached!","post_message":"The Keystone pipeline would bring a reliable supply of energy into our country â€“ providing opportunity, creating jobs and lowering the cost to ship goods, products and crops. The idea that Congress is sidestepping the normal process is out-of-touch with reality. This project has been studied for more than six years and has been given the green light at every obstacle. Arkansans and all Americans can see that President Obama is the real hurdle to Keystone. I will continue to support this project, and I urge the Senate to quickly vote to override this veto."},{"comment_id":"952148034847314","commenter_b":"How LOW can you go?

Give it to someone who has really done something who is a hero. He looks like talks like and walks like a man playing dress up in his mothers clothes","post_message":"Watch what Caitlyn Jenner said when she accepted the 'Woman Of The Year' Award.
