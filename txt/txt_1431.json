Idk how the laws are there but here in Ohio, especially in Cleveland where I'm from. You need to be carrying. I would've helped her in a heartbeat. No questions asked. Then criminals would think twice, if we all start defending ourselves.","commenter_a":"I'm so mad right now not only at the whole situation but nobody had the compassion to help her I'm thinking of that was my Mother, sister auntie etc... praying..","post_message":"CTA VICTIM ID'D: The woman who was stabbed repeatedly on a crowded Red Line train Thursday afternoon has been identified as 25-year-old Jessica Hampton."},{"comment_id":"1683593111700811","commenter_b":"That's why they have a little pill now called Plan B...take that the day after you're raped if you can't stand to carry the baby and put it up for adoption to a family who doesn't care how the child was conceived! Abortions, especially late term abortions are cruel and inhumane!","commenter_a":"It's planned parent hood they do a lot more then abortions. And @username women chose well some prolly forced so @username women got knocked up because they didn't practice safe sex. I thought women wanted the right to chose what they do with there bodies planned parent hood also helps with women's health who can't afford insurance or hospitals the government cut there funding right? So how can they help these people and if they closed right now you don't think @username people won't find someone else to do abortions. I promise if there not smart enough to use protection and pph closed you would see a lot of dumb young women ending up in ER with a coat hanger hanging out of them.

Oh that would be the Mexican border you say. So if they are detained at that border, no matter where they come from, why shouldn't they be sent right back over that border? It should be Mexico's responsibility to police those that are breaking their immigration laws and not letting them flow freely over our border. What is so funny and absurd about this?","post_message":"'See?
