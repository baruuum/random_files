And I'm a gun owner and a supporter of the Second Amendment. But I couldn't give you more credit that we need to deal with the wrong people getting guns, especially with mental illness. As you know, in Tucson we had a person who had all kinds of trouble and was able to buy a gun. In Virginia Tech. In Louisiana… So from a gun owner, from a reddest of red states, and a person who owns guns, more power to you.” —an attendee at Hillary’s town hall on gun violence prevention in Manchester, NH"},{"comment_id":"10153410521706336","commenter_b":"She is so dirty.","commenter_a":"Wonder why .. lol","post_message":"New documents released by a federal court show President Barack Obama called then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the night of the 2012 Benghazi attack – but the contents are being withheld by the U.S. Department of State."},{"comment_id":"1204381342954945","commenter_b":"something wrong","commenter_a":"What the hell???????????????????","post_message":"The UK government buildings put in hock to Muslims"},{"comment_id":"10155084473033984","commenter_b":"@username yes you are.... it's never enough for you people never enough","commenter_a":"Okay, this is absolutely disgusting and I am appalled by the behavior of these CRIMINALS, but I did not see this much coverage or outrage when those WHITE teen males abused then raped the black handicapped teen with a metal hanger, causing permanent damage to him internally... they were let off the hook by the way. Charges dropped... media barely covered it and there were even people who made jokes about it or defended the white teens... so next time one of you white people wants to cry how white privilege is not real or how the media ignores black on white crimes, think again. These black teens are getting the punishment they deserve while the white teens (that did worse as they caused physically permanent damage) are out and about, as if nothing happened.
