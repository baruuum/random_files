A person who was there for most of their presidency and knows them better than just about anyone has listed a few corrections. Bill says: \"In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\" The facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.

If you watch a video of people getting assaulted and are ok with it then you don't have much of a moral character. Why should America allow illegal immigrants to keep coming in and why shouldn't we have the ones here deported? There are legal ways of coming to this country use that rout and people will respect you more. Don't want to become legal then don't come to the USA. Stay in the country you are from.","commenter_a":"Wow, this is pretty pathetic. Considering Trump's numbers I believe we can infer he'll continue to do just fine without Buzzfeed's advertising lol.
