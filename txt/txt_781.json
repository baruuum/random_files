I hope return to their mind.","commenter_a":"We reject and condemn terroristic attacks which happened in Brussels today. These attacks make our travel to the Union Europeans' countries a more difficulty, and will sufer the syrian refugees and arab muslims who work there from a compulsive procedures at this regard from now on. These actions obstruct anyone wants to travel so as learning and resume his study and those that travel to enjoy short trip. #Islam is a peace religion. we will find your media tell u that muslim persons commited these actions..... but these persons don't believe in any religion, yes. they are extremists. they don't belong to us.

Americans shooting animals for fun! why are people shocked by this? Also these are HUNTERS not POACHERS, poachers take things from the body for monetary gain, hunters just kill either to cull or for pleasure. All hunting should be banned! We have no right to kill for pleasure, kill to survive as that's the order of things but never for pleasure.","post_message":"Another iconic animal lost to hunters."},{"comment_id":"10153163783266135","commenter_b":"When the death penalty came up, the idea was to deter people from killing. This is why I wrote, death penalty for killers. Killers should know that gas chamber is their end. But when the law starts making up excuses for their actions, every law goes out the window. Illegals guns hit the streets because its about money. When someone chooses to be stupid, is not about money, the culprit list will be long, and everybody should be hold accountable. So, should we shot everybody and ask later? There are some people who are paying the consequences for not thinking ahead, trying to uphold the laws in their hands, like some kind of hero. What exactly is a THUG? and what exactly is a GOOD person?","commenter_a":"Screw the 2nd ammendment, this clowns can not handle this right.
