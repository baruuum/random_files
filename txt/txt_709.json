You said it yourself. Men have been using the men's room and women have been using the ladies room without an issue since forever without any problems. My point is that the law allows for men to use the ladies room and women to use the men's room, that is the basis of this law.","commenter_a":"I want to know why this is such a 'hateful' law. The 'party of science' is arguing against a law that basically says 'You know this restroom that's for boys/men? Only boys/men can use it. You know this bathroom that's for girls/women? It's only for girls/women'. So you think if women feel uncomfortable that a man that says 'Hey, I feel like a woman' goes into a woman's locker room must hate LGBT people? Really? It's not the trans people I'm concerned about. It's the people POSING as trans people. Why should women be made to feel uncomfortable just so a man that thinks he's a woman can use the women's restroom/bathroom? Wanting people to use the bathroom of the sex they were BORN with (and actually STILL are, as science dictates) does NOT = hate.","post_message":"After nationwide outcry about North Carolina's harmful anti-LGBT law, Gov. McCrory said let's 'work on solutions that will make this bill better' because NC is 'a state of inclusiveness, openness and diversity.' Letâ€™s make it clear - that means REPEAL HB2. Keep the pressure on.
