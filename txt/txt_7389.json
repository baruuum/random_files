She even talked down to the commander in chief, President Barack Obama, while she was under his command.\""},{"comment_id":"1394765567230964","commenter_b":"Because they enjoy it. They love to rape. That's it.","commenter_a":"Im still confused. Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. ðŸ˜•","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"10153396902714270","commenter_b":"There are jobs women cannot do in our military, because they are unable to meet our standards.. (Combat arms) Pretending to be a man would get them in. Unable to meet standards, they would damage our combat effectiveness, ability to adapt, and endanger the mission. That, and people will get killed dragging them along instead of fighting the enemy. IF it is tolerated too long, they will wind up deployed in a combat situation. It will cost lives. Caught unable to meet standards in the rear will cost them a possible career, and they will be processed out. Nothing wrong with that to you?","commenter_a":"Being transgender is not a mental disorder. Both the APA and the AMA agree. Also nearly every single western military in the world allows transgender people to serve openly in the military. Even Israel, a country that has significant treats to their nation allows transgender people to serve openly. Plus there are already 15,000 transgender people serving in the US military right now. Their service should be honored and not conditioned upon whether or not they can keep their gender identity a secret.","post_message":"\"He began to suspect that the military, despite its ban on allowing transgender people to serve, was somehow attracting them at a disproportionately high rate.\""},{"comment_id":"10154592575994062","commenter_b":"Hang these neggos today !!!","commenter_a":"They don't even care that they took someone life, so no one should care when they are giving them the chair","post_message":"TODAY: 4 accused of robbing a Houston restaurant and killing a man are scheduled to appear in court."},{"comment_id":"10155939290119012","commenter_b":"No he's creating a disaster!! You cannot fix something that has been left go for decades! You can find a way to manage it and try and prevent the same things to keep happening! That is why Obama was smarter about it! He deported the ones that were a threat not a mother with kids! But I don't expect the right to understand this!

In 1994, she signed the mass incarceration bill with her husband, which put many black people in prison for small related crimes. Trump wants to fix the black communities, get a better educational system, and invest more in the schools. Vote for Hillary and black people will be suffering for another 4-8 years, just like the last 8 years when we had all these promises that never came.","post_message":"Michael Dale Vance Jr., the Oklahoma fugitive who authorities said shot two officers and killed two of his relatives last week, was killed in a shootout Sunday night, according to the FBI's Terry Weber."},{"comment_id":"10153962696310950","commenter_b":"Seriously?? You are part of the problem! What she is wearing is irrelevant! She shouldn't have to wear a turtleneck to keep creeps from thinking they have free reign.
