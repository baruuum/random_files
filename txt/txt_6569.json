Why does it seem that boys need to be educated against forcibly sexually attacking a woman? Like, hey! You shouldn't hurt that girl! Why is that something they need to be taught? Its like saying boys are rabid animals that need to be trained or something. Maybe they are, but why??!! I guess in the case of Nairobi born boys, if one in 4 women have been raped, perhaps they witness a lot of those attacks and it normalises the behaviour. But still. I am struggling to comprehend how a boy in ANY country comes to believe that raping a girl and causing her harm is normal. üòï","post_message":"In case you missed it: Take a look inside Kenya's successful rape prevention program."},{"comment_id":"1398317006928016","commenter_b":"I don't particularly like or support this woman for the position.
