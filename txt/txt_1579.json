This type of harvesting happens on a daily basis in 3rd world countries, poor desperate individuals selling their kidneys in back allies to rich benefactors. Most illegal organs are stolen form human trafficking.","commenter_a":"Organ harvesting and transport is complicated. You can't just slash a body and grab them out. This sounds like a ploy by the Iraqi govt to get headlines","post_message":"It's a startling claim. If true, what could be driving increasingly extreme tactics #ISIS is employing? @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153238433806782","commenter_b":"So you have no problem sharing a restroom with men? That's not how I perceive most women feel","commenter_a":"Oh for Pete's sake, does government really belong in the restroom???? Work on something that really matters! Schools, roads, infrastructure, the things government does belong. Are you going to post guards in every bathroom and have to check your 'plumbing' to see what you are equipped with to make sure you are going to right one???","post_message":"A similar bill was filed in Oklahoma: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154378235307061","commenter_b":"ironic since even king himself thought malcolm x was a hack","commenter_a":"I am a white man, but it seems to me that Islam provided to Afro-Americans a system of faith and structure that Christianity failed to do. These people took names of Islamic heroes, rather than the surnames of their owners. Muhammad Ali took stature when he changed his name from Cassius (Roman name) Clay (ancestor white owner?). In America we stand up for who are and what we believe to be right.","post_message":"Malcolm X was killed on this day 52 years ago. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153544166434024","commenter_b":"NY is the capital of THE WORLD!

I think he knows he couldn't get elected again in a fair election. But then again his lips were moving so he's probably lying anyway.","post_message":"What Obama just said about running for a third term is shocking.
