No questions of why, she had a private server. No questions at all, to prove intent. Sounds very fishy. They ( the FBI) just threw that in, ( No intent ) to get her off , from all the crimes that she committed","post_message":"The one thing she fears the most."},{"comment_id":"10153247991679342","commenter_b":"Abortion is good.
