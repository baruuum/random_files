What I really believe , is that the Republicans will have Trump tossed out of office within the first year. He is a Dangerous person , and he also has far too many enemies within the party. That is why he is surrounding himself with people he feels are loyal to him instead of people that actually have some knowledge of what really needs to be done. They are not going to forgive and forget his insults and his horrible attacks on them and their families. Ted Cruz and the gang are just biding their time until the inauguration.
