There's no reciprocation on the part of feminists because they only care about themselves. Even if I did respond how you wanted, you wouldn't address any of my points and simply make ad hominem attacks. That's all you people are capable of because you have no critical thinking skills.","commenter_a":"To the men commenting on this post that are shaming other men for being feminists: shame on you. You are just proving the very reason why we, as males, have much to benefit from feminism as well","post_message":"The male activists all face roadblocks.

To me, I'm just like, 'We gotta try something else.'\""},{"comment_id":"10154517045124087","commenter_b":"The Muslim ban from war torn nations is meaningless. Besides him not banning Muslims from Saudi Arabia - because they have \"great human rights\" over there from Women not being allowed to drive or throwing Gays off of roof tops; Trump says US will prioritize Christian refugees. How do you determine who is a Christian when one can easily lie about this? Congress will likely overturn this. While they're at it, Trump stop droning brown people overseas and Congress stop sending foreign aid to these terrorist organizations who indirectly receive it.","commenter_a":"Good","post_message":"BREAKING: President Trump has signed an executive order indefinitely banning all refugees from war-torn Syria and suspending all refugee entry for at least 120 days."},{"comment_id":"970468323009697","commenter_b":"@username PLEASE vote for Hillary she is on her way out, just ask Biden, ask Obama, ask Bernie, ask the FBI.
