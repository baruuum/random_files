I had my own phone number come up on Caller ID one time! there is a site that you can check out numbers, www.800notes.com to let others know about the callers but the telemarketers don't care about that site. I see a lot of people on there saying to \"Stop calling me!\" yet don't leave their number. Yes, I'm tired of the \"Lower Your Credit Card Interest\" or letting me know about a topical pain ointment.

Plus most of you are SCARED because you have either been the bully or profited from the bullying of other countries ! Just admit that you don't know how get your power back ! It seems to me that 9/11 made our county a rape victim and you see the rapist in every Muslim ! But we've used the same tactics! Oh , you didn't mind sending missionaries over there to convert them , but we don't want them here, even the ones that became Christians ! We reap what we sowed and you still don't see it or get it !
