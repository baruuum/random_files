How does that logic make any sense? It's called basic hygiene practices. FYI, as men age (much older) their penis could fold inside of him and it will need pulled out to keep clean. This could be the issue your Family member was talking about. It's no different than when you wash your own genitals.","commenter_a":"I have 3 boys and all are circumcised.
