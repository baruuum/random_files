She ran HP into the ground.","commenter_a":"I have thought the same thing about Carly Fiorina. I like her and believe technically she might make a good president. But she has a \"look\" about her, not about beauty or sexiness, but a look like she's been hurt badly sometime in her life and is going to have a nervous breakdown at any minute. Leadership also relies heavily on appearance and Ms. Fiorina's \"look\" just isn't motivational. It's almost all about appearance...when is the last time you've seen a multi-million dollar preacher that looks like he/she just lost their puppy? This country is going to need vitality to rebuild itself and she does not project that; FDR would not be photographed in his wheelchair and people still talk about Jimmy Carter's preacher look. We need and I haven't seen anyone that \"appears\" to resemble him, except maybe Sen. Marco Rubio, and only somewhat, a JFK.","post_message":"Trump was watching a newscast when a video clip zoomed in on rival Republican 2016 candidate Carly Fiorina. \"Look at that face!
