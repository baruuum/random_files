Hillary was involved in everything bill Clinton did!! Hillary had two terms (8) as a New York senator. Hillary had a term (4) years as Secretary of State. Yet, the old girl thought she could have her own server and NOT be held accountable for classified emails... When are Americans going to get pissed enough to hold the shrew responsible?? Hillary left four AMERICAN men to be tortured until dead in Benghazi. Could this be what she and her aids are hiding? As of Friday, as per a JUDGES order nothing has been turned over. The two aids hide behind an attorney and Hillary just never answered... Monday such be very interesting!","commenter_a":"She needs to STOP Monsanto instead of defending them.

What she poured into this election was ill gotten money. She sure didn't use her own. I Honestly feel her major Dissapointment is her self absorbed issues that would have only added more money to the Clintons Fraudulent Foundation . Being a Great Nation is now much more attainable without corrupt Killary and the rest of her lackeys.","commenter_a":"Wow. So much hate on these posts. I hear a lot of people upset about the protests going after she lost but it seems like there are just as many sore winners out there. Whether you like her or not, people need to learn some respect. I guarantee 99.9% of the people on here haven't the foggiest idea what it takes to hold a high ranking position in our government or run for president. She poured a lot of time and effort into her campaign and to still come up short must be a major disappointment. I'm sure a lot of people have done less and been more hurt by their own failures. I thought this was a country of conscience and good will. This election has proved we are much further from being a great nation than we claim.","post_message":"â€œI know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves if America is the country we thought it was.\""},{"comment_id":"911046885608046","commenter_b":"LIKE I SAID, SHE KILLED THOSE KIDS.

Not sure but to me this seems like a modern take on that...in most cases such dancing is done for the benefit of men. But when it is done to express one's sexuality in a personal way, it does have an empowering effect. It suggests that a woman's sexuality belongs to her and doesn't need a male audience to be valid.","post_message":"I never thought a pole-dancing video could be such a tearjerker.
