You never know when a preditor will change it's mind and attack. If it had decided to attack and start constricting around the child, they may have had trouble getting it off before it did harm, even with them watching. I don't think the child here is being abused or neglected, that obvious in the film. With all animals, things can go very wrong, very quickly.","post_message":"This video footage of a 14-month-old girl playing with the family pet might make you a little nervous."},{"comment_id":"1107974842571087","commenter_b":"She lies and lies and lies and lies and . . .","commenter_a":"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED BY YOUR NEW JOB DR BEN CARSON , YOU WERE BETTER AROUND WHITE COAT....[...]","post_message":"Is anyone surprised?"},{"comment_id":"458641870995513","commenter_b":"Can't stand this idiot...she has always been a crude, rude, big mouthed jerk.

She made a comment about Toya living her fairy tale and K Michelle thought it was in regards to her being a liar and she went in.. K Michelle's response called her a muppet and said that she preferred Toni.. So she can't play that Newton's Law card.. K Michelle is known for being a bully..
