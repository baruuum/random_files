Independently funded candidates like @username cannot stand a chance if our electoral system is rigged in favor of establishment, corporate-funded candidates. The evidence so far shows it is easy to hack many voting machines being used in elections. Aside from conducting a recount, we advocate Ranked Choice Voting and federal campaign financing, just a few solutions put forth by the Green Party in it's six-point plan for grassroots democracy. The Green Party Platform, which calls for \"publicly-owned, open source voting equipment and deploy it across the nation to ensure high national standards, performance, transparency and accountability; use verifiable paper ballots; and institute mandatory automatic random precinct recounts to ensure a high level of accuracy in election results.\" jill2016.com/recountfaq","post_message":"I am joined tonight with Kevin Ronca, the director and creator of the incredible docuseries, \"The Revolution Televised.\" Although only 13 minutes in length, each of these episodes get to the heart of the matter: exposing the corruption that has been taking place in our sick political system!

Mumford & Sons had nothing to do with THE CITIES/RESIDENTS. You can't blame a band for the amount of fans they attract, they're grammy award winning musciams coming of a 2 year hiatus after releasng a long awaited album. The city is the problem here for using this \"cleanout method\" which they are literally treating these people, HUMAN BEINGS, like trash and obviously have no problem using terms that state that. Blame the city not the band, oh and actually read the article.","post_message":"Not cool."}]
