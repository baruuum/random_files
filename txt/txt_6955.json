And you're telling me that the developers didn't take into account the possibility of the structures collapsing? I think they did. And in the midst of a terrorist attack, the split second decision had to be made; whether or not to take down the Structures in a controlled explosion ( which was probably designed during conception ) How would they have known whether or not any more explosives were going to go off? Tough call","post_message":"Were the twin towers, and more specifically, building 7 blown up by bombs on 9/11?

He got bad coverage in the NYTimes and research on the conservative voting base.  I just thought it was a typical trump circus non sequitur.  I hadn't seen this story until now.  I feel sorry for him.   It just isn't going to end well for him.  Maybe I am wrong but I just don't think the American conservative likes the bully act.  Is everyone who disagrees with him:  fat, ugly, stupid, loser or failing?  It is amazing to see anyone not in the Obama White House with an \"enemies list\" this large.  Be fore he ran for president he was always a nice hotelier to me and my family.     I said four weeks ago that I did not want him on the show as the only thing to be gained was fifteen minutes of ratings and seeing that my ratings have never been higher nor have my commercial rates been higher, I didn't feel it was worth the trade of integrity.  He is welcome on many talk radio shows.  Not mine.  I will stick with Cruz, Carson, Fiorina, Santorium, Paul and tomorrow Bobby Jindal.  My audience rates Donald Trump consistently in tenth place in the race.   We have spend the last 16 years learning about progressives.  My audience is not fooled.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"912105055515910","commenter_b":"The reality is that the absence of a father or a mother is felt by children who have grown up in single-parent household.
