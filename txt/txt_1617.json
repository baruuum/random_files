Yesterday a Texas court struck down the US Chamber of Commerce’s attempt to overturn a new Labor Department rule requiring retirement advisers to put their customers’ interests first. The decision affirms what we already knew: this conflict of interest rule was lawfully enacted and the rulemaking process took the views, costs, and benefits of all the stakeholders into account. Now President Trump needs to follow suit. He should stand up to the Chamber of Commerce — and the armies of lawyers and lobbyists that brought this frivolous lawsuit — and allow the rule to be implemented in April as planned.  Hardworking Americans saving for their retirement deserve to have a retirement adviser who is recommending the investments that are the best for their retirement security, not the ones that let advisers pocket kickbacks and prizes."},{"comment_id":"10154889313644411","commenter_b":"Well hes planning to shut alot of military bases around the world, and hes said hes not paying into nato waist of money he said, at the end of the day we all have to wait and see what hes going to do, you never know he might do a better job than all the other so called politicians in the past.....see how","commenter_a":"He has a point, and America needs a business man to balance the books and help the American people.","post_message":"[This comment contained a link to an external webpage which is not shown here.]"},{"comment_id":"337708566573297","commenter_b":"Trimp for president......HOW SCARY IS THST IDEA !!","commenter_a":"Vi a una persona que se preparo para el debate asi como se ha preparado para ser presidenta del pais.

I translate that into, we will not get rid of our free labor (slaves) so secession was the choice, I can see where economics played into it, but to say slavery was not part of those same economics would be terribly ignorant. Lincoln maintained that secession was illegal thus unless south gave in war was inevitable.","commenter_a":"Here is an explanation of the civil war directly from the FEDERAL Government which proves without doubt that the War was NOT about slavery.
