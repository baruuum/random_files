It is not right to say illegals. We are all part of the human race. As an American born citizen I say that Trump is wrong. Undocumented immigrants are very important to our work force. They work very hard. Some work harder than those born here. If we send all undocumented immigrants back it would put this nation under. Yes we have a immigration problem. But fix it the right way. Undocumented immigrants deserve a chance as we all do to live in a country like ours.","post_message":"Under the Eisenhower program, immigrants inside the U.S. were rounded up and deported to remote places, resulting in deaths and criticism of human rights abuses."}]
