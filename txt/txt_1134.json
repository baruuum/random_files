Go troll someplace elst.","commenter_a":"Children are innocent, they can't be held guilty for anything their parents say or do. And my question is how can you hate war refugees, and many of them children, and still claim you're Christian. The tenet of the religion is to care for the stranger, the wretched, and the sick. Not sure what part of that is hard to understand. Jesus was a refugee, and so were his parents, we seem to forget that. Bravo to the troops, they're doing the right thing.","post_message":"Kudos to these vets for speaking out against Trump."},{"comment_id":"1324679534258458","commenter_b":"The women who aren't giving it up are defending her.","commenter_a":"She might be asexual.","post_message":"'I love my husband ...
