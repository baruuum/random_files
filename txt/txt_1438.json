As long as the extremists face no serious consequences, they will just get more and more radical in their pronouncements and actions. Only when there is a very strong backlash is there any chance of them backing down, as we saw when the anti-communist witch hunts were finally contained. But religious extremism like Huckabee's is much harder to deal with (as Goldwater presciently saw), because they regard all resistance as persecution and attacks by spiritual enemies. Sadly there is a chance, even if it is small at the moment, that America will ride the tiger of extremism to disaster. And unlike Germany after WW2, there would be unlikely to be any second chances, any opportunity for redemption, because a radical, apocalyptic, theocratic USA would almost certainly initiate WW3.","post_message":"Mike Huckabee thinks that as president, he could prevent literally all abortion."},{"comment_id":"10153371491386336","commenter_b":"Not American and horrible woman","commenter_a":"Mother Teresa.","post_message":"With your help, #TheNew10 will be decided later this summer."}]
