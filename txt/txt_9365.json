This article is stating that obama could have stoped it and deliberately did not. This is fake news at its highest degree and is shameful because it uses the dead to tell a lie.","commenter_a":"Fake news: Moreover, the majority report issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi plainly stated that, minutes after learning about the ongoing attack at the U.S. diplomatic compound, President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta issued \"clear orders to deploy military assets\":","post_message":"Here's the proof folks. Both Hillary Clinton AND Barack Obama are now exposed for not pulling the trigger to save anyone's life in Benghazi, when they could. This is the end of their careers! Let's get 5,000 shares if you think they should both be locked away for war crimes."},{"comment_id":"10154335098801002","commenter_b":"Amy... are you serious?!?! IQ test?!?

The whole thing starts when a man can't keep it in his pants. He has no business telling women what they should or shouldn't do.","post_message":"Let me share a piece of myself. Yours truly was abandoned as a newborn by a man who now he is 100% against abortion. I guess me being taken to Arkansas and being raised by an abusive stepfather (and the first few years in a shack with an outhouse and a well for water) was OK. I appreciate that I had a chance at life. But you men who think you can make decisions for women? STFU. Now. ~tiff via Occupy Democrats"},{"comment_id":"10152860083811051","commenter_b":"Rene this country still has racism because some blacks won't let it go and grow up And Larry NOBODY wants this president to stay with him tearing down America and acting like a dictator.

Oh, by the way, I'm a female gun owner ;)","commenter_a":"She is a genius. I hope she realizes how hard your life can get when you make an enemy of the NRA! All you have to do is casually mention gun control or background checks and 50 whack - jobs will jump down your throat. If you're on t.v. it must be much much worse. Look what happened with Amy Schumer.","post_message":"Samantha Bee highlighted a glaring, surreal NRA double standard on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee yesterday, stockpiling a small weapons arsenal while trudging through red tape as she tried to nab her own Eddie Eagle costume, the NRA's gun safety mascot.
