When Jeb Bush signed the law forbidding to give the Driver License to illegal people in 2005 (he was the first governor to do it), he wanted to push the deportation of millions of illegal NON Cubans from Florida, who could not continue driving and give their jobs to millions of Cubans rafters newcomers. Bush never thought in unemployed veterans or other US citizens. He only has Cubans in his agenda.","commenter_a":"He will lead this country to a war in the sand...and your children will be buried there.....","post_message":"How a group of hecklers forced Jeb Bush to go off script and talk about immigration."},{"comment_id":"10154274649819087","commenter_b":"Dear Democrats and Liberals, I'm noticing that a lot of you aren't graciously accepting the fact that your candidate lost. In fact you seem to be posting even more hateful things about those of us who voted for Trump. Some of you are apparently 'triggered'. Because you are posting how 'sick' you feel about the results. How did this happen you ask. You created 'us' when you attacked our freedom of speech. You created 'us' when you attacked our right to bear arms. You created 'us' when you attacked our Christian beliefs. You created 'us' when you constantly referred to us as racists. You created 'us' when you constantly called us xenophobic. You created 'us' when you told us to get on board or get out of the way. You created 'us' when you forced us to buy health care and then financially penalized us for not participating.

If feminist hated all women who dressed nice and looked pretty. She is an attractive woman. I won't comment on her alternative income or employment. Selling your vagina to make money is about the most American and feminist thing I can think of.

The reason that women cannot be priests is that the priest acts in the person of Christ in the Mass. If it's a woman offering the Mass the sacrifice becomes one of bride to bride - and the significance is lost. Humans are sensual creatures. God knew that; that's why He created sensual experiments (the Sacraments) as visible signs of His grace. You cannot baptize someone with motor oil because it's not a sign of cleansing. Similarly, you cannot ordain a woman. It is not possible.","commenter_a":"st paul says there is no difference between men and women now that we are in Christ Jesus. there is nothing to suggest that women cannot be ordained priests or deacons from the mouth of Jesus himself. the fact that only men were chosen by him could be due to the fact that the social fabric of his day could not tolerate or make it possible otherwise. the holy spirit will continue to guide the church according to christ's own promise. let's not bar the way forward when we see he is driving along that path. we need to go to the spirit of our faith and not be kept back by men made rules and practices. WE HAVE TO LET THE LORD SPEAK.....AND LET US BE SILENT.","post_message":"The Catholic Church can never ordain women priests, so why all the confusing signals?"}]
