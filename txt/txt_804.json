If she gets in everybody better run like hell!","commenter_a":"Actually, Clinton was talking ABOUT trump since trump HIRED illegal immigrants! Clinton didn't put anyone down when stating this. Every president/candidate has said this. It's how and what you say that make a difference. Trump wouldn't be called a racist etc. If he didn't put a whole country/religion down with name calling. There's a HUGE difference between what bill said and what trump says. Whoever can't see that needs help...","post_message":"Do you think this sounds a lot like Donald J. Trump?
