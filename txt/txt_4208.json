Okay....","commenter_a":"Save natural causes, racism has directly or indirectly been the cause of death to every single black in this country. Ponder that statement for a minute, because it is the truth. If you are black, eventually racism will most likely lead to the cause of your death, whether it is diet, subsequently health, or murder. The degree of oppression will take its toll. Dying of a natural cause is a luxury that few blacks will enjoy, and by natural cause, I refer to old age only. The degree in which we are hated is only mildly expressed in this video. The odd man out is usually hated with a vengeance, and we been tasked with that role since day one.

It seems Donald Trump is poised to kick down doors concealing issues that mainstream media and mainstream candidates fear to even discuss. The competence level of our leaders in government and their weak attempt to compete in world markets is one of this countries forbidden issues. The other forbidden issue is the democratic party position that Islam has nothing to do with violence, as opposed to Donald Trump explosive position that hates us.

She also has to take a truckload of pills every day in order to make sure she gets enough nutrients so she won't have other health problems from not eating enough. Anyone doing any research on gastric by-pass will find that it's not the solution to weight loss, and in some cases, they're much worse off than before. This woman isn't so fat that she can't lose the weight on her own. The problem is she doesn't want to lose weight. If your \"want to\" isn't there, even gastric by-pass won't be very effective.
