The point of a dating site is to meet potential partners, usually of the opposite sex. How many women are subscribed to Ashley Madison I wonder? Oh, wait. I forgot! If a woman is on a site like this it can't be because she is a \"cheating dirtbag\"! It must be because she is \"exploring female empowerment\". Both sexes have a sex drive that can override sensible decision making processes. Both men and women are equally capable of cheating on their partners, so please The Huffington Post drop the \"all men are evil\" act and think before you type!","post_message":"“Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...\" Ashley Madison"},{"comment_id":"10153507892259203","commenter_b":"Figure out how to get guns from criminals.

Every country that has gun restrictive laws and gun control is a prosperous nation whose avid hunters and gun clubs (shooting ranges) also prosper.

But, The KKK in the early 20 th century, hijacked this Flag, (Symbol) and carried out Murder, Lynching and Devastation to many in the South, and all over America ! Unfortunately, but accurately, these two SYMBOLS represent, Horror & Evil beyond most comprehension. Many perceive the Swastika as Evil, (When related to The Nazi Party, they're correct) & Many perceive the Confederate Flag as Evil, (When related to Racism, they're correct).
