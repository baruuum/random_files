Im all for protection, but Trump's actions are based on nothing but his ignorance and fear. That is no way to live and that is no way to run a country.","commenter_a":"If DHS doesn't support this, isn't that a sign that maybe it's not the right thing to be doing? I'm pretty sure they're not a liberal organization, so this isn't a partisan issue. If you're scared of terrorists, I get that. But wouldn't it be better to open your mind a little and try to understand why so many people are against this?","post_message":"The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday it has suspended all actions to implement President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration order."},{"comment_id":"10153423460374087","commenter_b":"@username You will be pleased to know that I will be running for president in 2036, with @username as my running mate. We will be running on the Republican ticket which should also please you. Donald Trump is a man of one line punches with no specificity as to how he will execute his policies.

All of a sudden because Hillary lost the election now the Electoral votes have to go, maybe if you picked a candidate that wasn't crooked and a continual liar you might have had a better chance.
