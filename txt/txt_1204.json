'..recipients (of welfare) choose the day and time of the testing..' This is how it's done in all these examples and *THAT* is why there was only one person that failed. Most drugs are out of your system (and won't show on a dipstick test) in less than 48 hours. Do *RANDOM* drug screening like I have to do for my job.

Who reads the terms and conditions on anything online these days? Very few. I haven't thought of a solution re advertising, and the way things are going its only going to become more intrusive.
