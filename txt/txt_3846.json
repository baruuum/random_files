The fact is we have two parties that lead us in this country. The democrats have a criminal and a socialist as front runners in their campaign. So I have no alternative but to endorse the republican party. If my friend that liked this post feels that makes me anti American then I guess we don't know each other as well as I thought.","post_message":"This HAS to be said.

The minorities already have the right to vote. Sorry if they won't let you count the votes that some people made with the names of dead people. Illegal aliens don't have the right to vote, because they are not citizens of the USA.","commenter_a":"As long as the current conservative, sorry ass Republicans are controlling both the House and Senate, there will never be a vote on a new Voting Rights bill!!!:( They are against anything good for minorities, women, seniors, and the working class.","post_message":"On this day in 1965 President Johnson gave his Voting Rights Act Address to Congress.

Bill Clinton had a few token Hispanics in his administration so did George Bush and very few with President Obama. Now Clinton and Sanders are also clamoring for our vote. They will probably get the majority of Hispanics to vote for a Democrat but I have a feeling that once Sanders or Clinton get in it will be more of the same for Hispanics in high governmental positions, Nada or muy poquito!, Trump has alienated about 99.9% of Latinos and every other race and if he gets in who knows what he will try to do with every so called minority group in America.
