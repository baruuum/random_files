He doesn't know policy, he doesn't think ahead, and he stumbles when it comes to content. Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz. I write such because the thought of Trump facing Hillary in debate makes me cringe. Kasich, the newest favorite of the GOP, cannot win. I love my home state, but Ohio doesn't save Kasich from toppling.","post_message":"Not budging."}]
