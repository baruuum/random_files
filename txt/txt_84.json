The parent who allows their child to disturb all the people around them trying to enjoy a meal is inconsiderate and selfish! The excuse that the child is waiting too long for food is poor at best. You as a parent and should come prepared to entertain your child... That includes providing them snacks and toys. The parents should have removed that child from the table within 5 minutes of the unresolved tantrum. Yes... I am a parent and never allowed that to happen. Remember that you are not the only person in that establishment spending hard earned money to enjoy a simple meal!","post_message":"DINER OWNER YELLS AT CRYING CHILD: \"I turned around, slammed both hands on the counter and then pointed at the child and said, 'This has got to stop!'\" said Darla Neugebauer, after she says a toddler cried for more than 40 minutes.
