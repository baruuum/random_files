If you watch a video of people getting assaulted and are ok with it then you don't have much of a moral character. Why should America allow illegal immigrants to keep coming in and why shouldn't we have the ones here deported?

Stay in the country you are from.","commenter_a":"Wow, this is pretty pathetic. Considering Trump's numbers I believe we can infer he'll continue to do just fine without Buzzfeed's advertising lol.

Why do Asians, Europeans and other immigrants acclimate themselves into society but after 150 years blacks still expect others to take care of them. They are a society of takers and beggers.
