You put a cover over your mind and give thanks that mothers can feed portably whilst not being excluded. I'm sure you can train your mind to manage to view a pair of breasts as a feeding devise and look at how your own mind processes this function. Women relinquish enough do to our biology - can't we at least feed and belong at the same time?","commenter_a":"She should have stayed home.

Much more than a lump of cells. At 18-22 week the child can be born and live a normal life 9 time s out of 10 even if the mother's life is in danger at this point there is no more dangers to birth over abortion. On top of that... healthy infants get adopted by people that want them...","commenter_a":"This has nothing whatsoever to do with humane treatment. It's another attempt at shaming the woman for making her own personal choice and finding a way to punish her. This is also another ill-fated attempt at giving a fetus, a few cells, personhood. A fetus nor a clump of cells can be made to be treated as a once living, breathing human being, nor should it be treated as such. As soon as these \"lawmakers\" can dictate that, it's a short road to personhood, to claiming murder and denying a woman a choice and having autonomy over her own body.","post_message":"About 35,000 public comments poured into the Texas Health and Human Services Commission about the rule change."}]
