This bill is not the answer to a difficult problem. Some of the folks that have posted think this is a great bill. They aren't stopping to realize that it will cost more to house, feed, and send these people back to wherever they have come from, which is probably a very unsafe place or why would they have left in the first place? I hope this bill is seen for what it is, a terrible step in the wrong direction and hopefully our Senators will have more sense than to pass it into law. If you will check the numbers, in recent years more undocumented people have left the United States than have entered.","post_message":"The vile legislation that is now before the Senate might as well be called the \"Donald Trump Act.\" Like the disgusting and outrageous language championed by Donald Trump, this legislation paints all immigrants as “criminals and rapists.” Local law enforcement officials, domestic violence groups, immigrants’ rights groups, mayors, faith leaders and labor groups all oppose the \"Donald Trump Act.\" This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe, and it certainly does nothing to address our broken immigration system."},{"comment_id":"10153385020755329","commenter_b":"don't talk that way about yourself.","commenter_a":"Pathetic idiot","post_message":"\"Growing up, I thought of Bruce Jenner as the kind of man I could never become.
