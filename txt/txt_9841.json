If the dems ever run a \"Trump\"like candidate, the super delegate system would be designed to stop that person. 2. Getting more than a small percentage of voters to the primary booths will make the dem party more democratic than overhauling the super delegate system","post_message":"Ending the superdelegate system is what will make the Democratic Party more democratic. This is the kind of grassroots democracy that will help the Democratic Party grow and win elections."},{"comment_id":"477691072379670","commenter_b":"Where are the weapons and the drugs??????????Ha!Ha!","commenter_a":"The majority of people coming across the southern border are peasant farmers. They bring illiteracy and tuberculosis.","post_message":"When some Americans think of illegal immigrants, they picture gang members. Drug dealers. Ruthless job stealers. Armed with hypodermic needles and Ebola, coming here to beat puppies and filch Girl Scout cookies, while toting crates of cocaine, prObama propaganda, and other satanic supplies. But what do real immigrants look like, and what do they bring to the US?"},{"comment_id":"1792810264314039","commenter_b":"Encoded in every religion is the belief of the family unit,man and women create children and society moves on. The radical notion that homosexuals can reproduce and create this dynamic is laughable and should not be lauded as some great thing for society. Man and women really do have different roles in society and its quite apparent no matter how society wants to change it. Secondly, racism is flat out wrong but we are doing a damn good job for a country so young with diverse groups of people.Religious freedom made this country and most of its core tenets come from the Christian bible and not the quran or any other text. Churches should be taxed if they become political and held to task on their beliefs in the marketplace. The past 8yrs tried to change America but Americans bit back and won.I am not talking political just basic morality ...","commenter_a":"Let's get rid of tax free status for churches.","post_message":"What a great idea. Let's end the separation of church and state. Let's convert religious organizations into political organizations. Let's funnel dark money funds raised by religious organizations into political campaigns. Let's sanction racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination under the guise of \"religious freedom.\" This absurd and unconstitutional idea must not be passed by Congress."},{"comment_id":"10154704340591509","commenter_b":"Don't feed the troll people.","commenter_a":"Why didn't this man order a bride from Russia, or a number of countries which pimp put their very ready and willing women.","post_message":"\"When I woke up I didn't know that I was in China.\""},{"comment_id":"1754857141240693","commenter_b":"@username The trash should be put down !","commenter_a":"They saying there's no tv the food crap and can't go to the gym well you shouldn't do the crime","post_message":"Britain's third biggest prison is in the midst of a riot."},{"comment_id":"10153009343111130","commenter_b":"My mother was too.
