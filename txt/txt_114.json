If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten! When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.

That's why having your ccw's is so important. I will not leave without my .22, might not kill you, but it could save my life.

I hope you idiots are paid to post all these ridiculous comments.","commenter_a":"Wind and solar don't make any sense, you have to cut down large areas of forest's to put up windmills on mountain tops to construct them, and they end up killing many birds. Same goes for solar, you would have to blanket the continental US with solar panels to replace fossil fuels. It's got nothing to do with \"evil big business\", wind and solar will just never be as efficient and reliable as coal, oil, and natural gas.","post_message":"A natural gas plant in Lycoming County is now complete, and it provides energy to nearly 1 million families in our area and other parts of the northeast."}]
