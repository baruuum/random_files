Heck, even their naming scheme. About the only difference today is they do most things in aluminum instead of white plastic, but it still has the same design queues. But who can blame them? When you have so many people branded to buy your products without blinking, change would be scary.","commenter_a":"Let's hope so. Apples design has been stale & stagnant for the last 15 years. For a company who is lauded for it's design, I can't believe It's gone this long without some fresh blood or new design ideas.","post_message":"Jony Ive just got promoted to Apple's C-suite.

Christie came out strong when he was elected Governor but it's been all down hill since. Why talk about Brady, not even his State. As for the wall, it worked for thousands of years for China. Plus it's a hell of a lot cheaper than what it is costing us in welfare, medical, food stamps, crime, law enforcement, prisons..... Put the people collecting welfare to work, take the young men like the CCC and WPA days. Bring our military home and build the wall.","post_message":"“Please, please, please do not fall for the idea that we are going to build a wall along the entire 2,000-mile border of the United States and Mexico ...
