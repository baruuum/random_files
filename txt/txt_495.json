He lived with a gun in his hand – and sometimes, it seems, a croquet mallet.

There is a reason the government won't allow the American Citizen know where all those illegal kids and familes went to in OUR country. I'm sure the CDC would show there is a correlation between this outbreak and where these illegals settles. Look to those liberal states that have santuary cities.","commenter_a":"Funny we had nothing like this going on until illegals flooded our border.","post_message":"For many conservatives, resolving issues of faith and science can be tricky.

However, white women wear wigs and added hair too. 95% of them in hollyweird do.","commenter_a":"I think this is significant when many African American female celebrities wear wigs that look like Caucasian hair, because of our so-called standards of beauty. I think the natural look is much more attractive and empowering for girls who look to them as role models.","post_message":"“If you say you’re beautiful without hair and makeup, then they will believe you,' Maria Borges said of the hairstyle she walked during the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show."},{"comment_id":"977002452335214","commenter_b":"Slaves","commenter_a":"the American people need to rebel against this. Citizens of a nation( especially one a great as america) should not have to live in fear of police persecution. The whole police force needs reform. The dirty cops, racist cops and just dam right bad police officers need to go. If your a trigger happy racist peace of shit who hides behind a badge and a gun to only parade around saying your a protector of peace, you need to be weeded out. Police in america don't know how to be police.
