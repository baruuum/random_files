I think it's a complete fallacy that illegal immigration should be such a focal point in this election. Its not our biggest problem. Our growing deficit and out of control federal government seem to be a bigger threat to our country!","commenter_a":"We are going to loose this election while small minded people focus on small minded things. Stock footage and former adult stars in commercials aren't going to destroy this country the people are! Because they can't seem to focus on the problems we are facing and examine the solutions of the candidates.","post_message":"Oh, the perils of stock footage."},{"comment_id":"10152694335031094","commenter_b":"^Calls other women whores^","commenter_a":"Anti-science lunatics...UGH!!!!!!","post_message":"The federal government has confirmed more than 100 people across 14 states have now developed measles. Will state governments respond by rescinding personal belief exemptions for parents who choose not to vaccinate their children?"},{"comment_id":"949766655064193","commenter_b":"What I don't understand about the anti-vaxers is the sheer number of people who have received vaccinations and they cite a couple of examples. I could probably list more damage caused by Legos to children than vaccinations. It is sad and scary that these people are convinced of some global wide conspiracy endorsed by world governments to pump out children full of poisons so big pharmaceutical companies can turn a profit. Do they actually listen to how ridiculous they sound? Canada officially listed the measles as eradicated from our country several years ago, now thanks to people refusing to vaccinate their children, there were 500 reported cases last year. Any other eradicated diseases you anti-vaxers want to see make a come back?","commenter_a":"Ugh, here come the anti-vaxxers with their pseudoscience and limitless idiocy. By not vaccinating, you are killing or at least potentially endangering children. End of. ** I feel that I should add to this, that I'm referring to parents of children who are perfectly capable of being vaccinated but who aren't; I get that there are issues with some childhood diseases and allergies and such.","post_message":"Maybe this'll end it. #vaccineswork"}]
