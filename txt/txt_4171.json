Southern white belle. She was raised that way. She can't help it that she was taught to not think for herself and be afraid of being touched by a black person.","commenter_a":"HELL NO!!! This black racist woman is a poor excuse as a human being, she would only use and abuse the American people just as her failure of a husband did. No more Obama's or Clinton's should be allowed near The White House!!","post_message":"Do you think Michelle Obama could make a good president some day?"},{"comment_id":"1245131405583109","commenter_b":"Hillary said she carries hot sauce with her to pander to blacks and said they are predators.

Elizabeth Warren has forgotten more about economics than he ever knew. And Hillary's foreign policy knowledge is something he will never acquire. She will decimate him in a debate because he will have to be ready to speak on issues, not just make personal attacks. He is so thin skinned that he will self destruct as soon as she holds his feet to the fire. He and his followers don't have a clue. They have demonstrated time and again that when all else fails, thuggery rules. That doesn't win elections once reasonable people make up their minds not to put up with it any more. Now I just hope that reasonable people do that sooner than later. Put him out of his misery as quickly as possible.","post_message":"He's got a problem."},{"comment_id":"10153278015134575","commenter_b":":) Exactly","commenter_a":"If you're going to do BUSINESS in a free society that is supposed to separate religious beliefs from law of the land then we must require you to be tolerant & serve anyone & everyone who walks through your doors. (Remember? Separation of church & state? One of our country's founding principles?) Besides-supporting intolerance & bigotry is an abuse of the word Christian. Jesus would not turn anyone away.","post_message":"\"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no.\" An Indiana pizzeria finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's religious freedom law."}]
