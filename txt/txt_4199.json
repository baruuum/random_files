He has opened our doors to terrorists, communists, illegals and Ebola. He has no respect for our military at all. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what he's doing.","commenter_a":"Love Sheriff Clark.","post_message":"Barack Obama is a USELESS president.

Unlike Obama, Trump has control of congress and can appoint to the Supreme court due to the opening. Obama never had that amount of power. Plus Obama was a moron. Trump needs to build that wall. Trump needs to build camps and round up all illegals that can be found. Put them in internment camps till they can be removed to their country of origin. Or just put them in prison like he said for 5 years if they come in the country illegally. We have our president now like the minorities had Obama.","commenter_a":"It is not Van Jones' job to correct people to take away their fears. It is the Trump camp's job to do so. Don't tell people when to feel afraid and when not. You have to make them feel safe and welcome. Donald Trump is the President now. Now he has to do his job for ALL.","post_message":"\"You need to back off.\" CNN's Van Jones exchanged hot words with a Donald J.

English nationalism is not the civic nationalism that we are trying to achieve in Scotland. The feathers of the establishment have been rattled by,first the referendum, and then the GE. The audacity as the Mail sees it is for Scotland to be ungrateful subsidy junkies who have sent 56 SNP MPs to Westminster to represent their constituents. To carry on this vilification that Cameron promoted during the GE campaign, only months after love bombing Scotland, is to let a Genie out of a bottle that won't go back in. The union could and should end in an agreement between too friendly nations who share an island by the voting power of the people of Scotland, and not by this ever increasing acrimony fostered by the English press. It's a dangerous and unprincipled ...","post_message":"Did the Scottish National Party (SNP) hound Charles Kennedy to his death?"}]
