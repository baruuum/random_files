The couple wasn't discriminated against. The kliens simply didn't want to participate in something they deem as sinful. How is that forcing their beliefs on them. So now they are out of business and the militant intolerant left made it happen. While our backward minded liberal pals are doing their best to persecute Christians at the same time and probably at this very moment Muslim bakers regularly turn away gays. These incidents do get reported but the liberal media refuses to report on them and the militant LGBT stay silent.","post_message":"A Daily Signal Exclusive: Bakers Facing $135K Fine Over Wedding Cake for Same-Sex Couple Speak Out"},{"comment_id":"741677189266873","commenter_b":"Really Rubio you must have a small dick.
