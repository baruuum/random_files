YES MICHAEL JACKSON AND PRINCE MAY HAVE BEEN DRUG ADDICTS, BUT THEY WERE BOTH AN INCREDIBLE TALENT, AS WAS WHITNEY HOUSTON ON THE FEMALE SIDE. SHE UNFORTUNATELY WAS A DRUG ADDICT. BUT SHE HAD AN INCREDIBLE VOICE. BUT ALL I AM SAYING IS LEAVE THE JUDGEMENTS TO GOD, BECAUSE I AM SURE YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SIN.","commenter_a":"Who cares, he was a drug addict just like Jackson.

We shouldn't punish an innocent baby because of the sins of the father. I mean how many of us would be here if we were punished for the sins of our mothers and fathers?? Murdering your baby doesn't make you any less raped. My opinion is the morning after pill should be available with every rape kit.","post_message":"What the hell is wrong with this woman?"},{"comment_id":"10153245617818908","commenter_b":"So, let me get this straight, a man with his foreskin is unhygienic, but a woman with her parts all tucked away inside is hygienic? How does that logic make any sense? It's called basic hygiene practices. FYI, as men age (much older) their penis could fold inside of him and it will need pulled out to keep clean. This could be the issue your Family member was talking about. It's no different than when you wash your own genitals.","commenter_a":"I have 3 boys and all are circumcised. As a person that has family in the medical field it's for cleanliness when they get older. My mother worked in a nursing home and she has horror stories from having to bath uncircumcised men. It's gross not to be.
