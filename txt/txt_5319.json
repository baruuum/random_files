Fix what's wrong in your relationship and if it's unfixable then leave, DON'T CHEAT.","post_message":"Woman who has had 100 affairs with married men blames their wives"},{"comment_id":"10153348953162217","commenter_b":"I saw a mother the other day getting into her car with her pjs, slippers and a cup of tea/coffee.
