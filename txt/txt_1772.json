Just another bunch of racists who want to vent there vile shit.. Any excuse.. Like yeah if your Muslim your a terrorist if your black your a mugger or rapist.. Retards!!","post_message":"Obama Doesn't Want You To See This: The Muslim Refugee Crisis in Europe"},{"comment_id":"10152736026831051","commenter_b":"Liberal logic - Ban guns because you can call the police but the Police are Militant racists that can't be trusted so who are we supposed to call again? Ban all guns in the U.S. it will make us safer but keep the borders open so when the black market opens the guns can flow in like water. On an ending note; Police are in no way obligated to protect you from any threat per the Supreme Court so I guess when they do show up they can draw that chalk outline around your fresh corpse.","commenter_a":"Blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit out of all the diehard ammosexual blowhards who love their guns. Europe doesn't have the problems we have in the country with guns. Neither does Canada or Australia. You want to believe what you want to believe. Follow the money. It's the NRA who wants you to keep your guns and fills your head with nonsense that you're just too willing to believe because you have no balls and tiny dicks. Try thinking about things instead of just buying into the rhetoric. The USA is safer now than at any other time in history. Why do you need them? Why focus on fairy tales like imagined revolutions against the government instead of focusing on things that are ACTUALLY happening like kids being killed in schools by LEGALLY OWNED GUNS.","post_message":"A company that worked on ‘Taken 3’ with Liam Neeson didn’t take kindly to his comments about the U.S."},{"comment_id":"10155922469974199","commenter_b":"All he's got to do is offer residency or citizenship to all of the workers who are here illegally and who are will to work on the wall for minimum wage and he could probably build that wall for 5 billion. And technically Mexico would be paying for it.","commenter_a":"This man is a joke and you guys really elected him. We are all doomed under his watch","post_message":"President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that he is aware of the new costs estimates for the proposed wall along on the U.S. border with Mexico.   A government analysis suggests the wall could cost $15 billion, and possibly as much as $25 billion.  How much are you willing to pay for the wall?"},{"comment_id":"1267255170019683","commenter_b":"Trump never said that - the Media always twist his words. Evil Hillary, said that no one needed guns - Trump said, OK - start with dis-arming your security guards. What does she do? Tripled her armed guards. Queen Liar Hillary / that Muslim Traitor Obama / & Soros are the U.S. worst 3 enemies that we have ever had. Because of all the evil Muslims that they have flooded our country with - we will probably be in a Civil War here on our soil - before the election - since they are losing really bad - they will not wait to try a Complete Muslim Take Over. Obama's ISIS has already stated -- We will Kill 90% of all Americans before 2017. Of course, that will be All White & Christians. Can not people see how EVIL those 3 Muslims are - 2 countries have promised a N. ...","commenter_a":"Are you judging this , like when Trump asked them to take the guns from her secrect service men , so she could be assassinated. Trump said the same thing ,but you just look over it.","post_message":"Watch for yourself and you be the judge. Hillary was asked about wanting to assassinate WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, using a drone. Assange has been a thorn in her side throughout her campaign.  When she finally answered, I've gotta say, I was more uneasy than when the reporter asked the question. This is NOT someone I would want in the White House under any circumstances.  Do you find her answer as disturbing as I do?"},{"comment_id":"644948305695748","commenter_b":"She is still ugly","commenter_a":"I wish I could believe she would pay for this and Obama too","post_message":"Michelle was just caught red handed and is about to be charged with treason.

Meanwhile every civilization that recorded their history speak of giants. How can one make up or imagine Giants without being exposed to them or having seen them? Just like they wrote about hybrid races u think they made it up? Nope I think archaeologists (not all) but as a whole cover things up so they can keep getting funded. I don't by into dinosaurs, I think they are the hybrids ancient cultures speak about but hey if a man in a white lab coat says the grass is really blue a third of mankind would eventually start to see blue too. To each Is own tho","post_message":"A team of archaeologists have uncovered the skeletal remains of a giant in the Bulgarian city of Varna. Located on the eastern shores of the Black Sea, Varna is now a major tourist attraction. The area has a rich culture and its history goes all the way back to 5,000 BC. The oldest golden treasure in the world was found during excavations at the Varna Necropolis and carbon dating revealed it was buried more than 6,500 years ago.
