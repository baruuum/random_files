The victim opened the door to the attacker after he knocked, apparently targeting her at random, police said. He pushed into the apartment and beat her, but she was \"feisty\" and able to fight him off, an LAPD captain said.  The man, who was caught on surveillance video, is described as a black man 25 to 30 years old, 6 feet tall, 220 pounds. He wore a black Penn State hoodie at the time of the attack."},{"comment_id":"10153881330947434","commenter_b":"So funny how some morons predict an armageddon just because their feminist messiah didn't win.","commenter_a":"Except for the fact that Jill is only asking for recounts in places where Trump won narrowly and has continually ignored asking for recounts in areas where Hillary won by even less votes. It's not about electoral integrity, it's about a woman having an infantile, foot stomping temper tantrum because she didn't get her own way.","post_message":"Jill Stein herself, standing across the street from Trump Tower, encouraged the president-elect to support her campaign’s efforts to ensure that every vote is accurately counted. “There is nothing to be afraid of,” Stein said, “if you believe in democracy.”"},{"comment_id":"640100692862928","commenter_b":"Trolls- in 4 years we have elections again- what if next time the candidate you don't like cheats to win?

It could have went awry. Maybe the mother has some mental issues. Only God knows what was in her mind. One thing for sure though, its alive n has chance to be somebody. Not just an aborted baby thrown in a trash can or its innocent body parts sold on the black market. Evil comes in all shapes n sizes. One of them is planned parenthood.","commenter_a":"I'm glad she didn't abort the baby, but this is still a sad story. Calling it a \"selfless\" act, as this article does, is a head scratcher. \"Desperate\" maybe, but if anything, abandoning a baby without notifying anyone is exactly the opposite of selfless. There are safe havens in NY where she could have turned over the baby to actual people","post_message":"\"I followed the cries.
