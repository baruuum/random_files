The claim of ignorance is part of the diabolical ruse but this mess is all cooly calculated and designed to preserve the racial hierarchy, which these days is often called \"racial disparities.\" Which I say is a bureaucratic term used to obscure the genocidal potential of white supremacy. How could a culture of people who have so meticulously sought to prove their superiority in all things, be so intellectually dense about how racism works? Slavery is well understood by white America because for the past 150 years it has ingeniously recreated it over and over again and called it by another name while playing dumb.
