The President cannot be trusted to follow the law.

Marco Rubio originally helped sponsor the Senate bill, but now says that he opposes any immigration reform until the border is secure FIRST.

It is obvious that the Democrats are more concerned with political victories than what is best for the country. This is one time when the Republicans should not, and CANNOT simply acquiesce to the other side who refuses to compromise.
