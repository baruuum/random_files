That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in Chapter 2 Section 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by 'force, violence, or other unconstitutional means.'

However we are definitely called to judge actions. In the case of same-sex marriage to support same-sex marraige is to supoort something that goes against the Bible's definition of marraige. Same-sex marraige is social, cultural, and traditional. Social, cultural and traditional acceptance will change with time but Biblical truth does not. Therefore I believe that we are to love everyone but support what is right in the eyes of the Lord.","post_message":"Brenda Wood 11Alive looks back at the fast-moving and historic events of last week in Monday's Last Word -- 'Same-sex marriage: Judgement Day.'
