I don't think so . You shouldn't even be allowed into the court house let alone the court room for reasons of security .","post_message":"This judge just made a controversial decision... Great.

So-called common wisdom has it that they don't want them because they're potential troublemakers. Your idea makes more (and scarier) sense.","commenter_a":"I don know if anyone realizes what is going on. I always tried to grasp the larger picture; go from the general to the specific and not the other way around. Europe and soon America are under invasion. None of the typical Arab countries have taken the Syrian refugees. Fact. Why? Because they want them to overwhelm the western nations. Infiltrate the society. Surround the culture and change civilization as we know it. At that point, it done. Pretty simple, isn it? Sorry, not if I can help it. Islam is a political movement masquerading as a religion.
