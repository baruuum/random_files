The Federal Government protects our borders, prosecutes Federal crimes (FBI) and unifies States with Federal Laws under the constitution. That's ALL I WANT THEM TO DO. I support Trump cleaning house on the outrageous spending the Federal Government has been doing for some time. PBS can go back to private funding and telethon like they did when I was a kid. NPR, same idea. They need to raise their own money like any other radio/news outlet. The amount of fees we will begin to charge Mexico for deporting all the people they let cross over will pay for The Wall. In taxes to Mexico for importing goods here. Learn basic Economics and US Government people, geez...","commenter_a":"The best part about PBS, NPR, and those other arts programs that are getting cut is that they actually don't cost that much.
