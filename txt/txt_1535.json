Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other! I can't wait for the future of America!üá∫üá∏üöÇ‚ù§Ô∏è","commenter_a":"Our country is full of spoiled people who are so used to having things their way, they act like a class of 5 y/o kids who didn't get the green marker! Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was 'stronger together, peace, love, equality'......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters.
