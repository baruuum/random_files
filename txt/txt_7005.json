Basically, all it is is reducing the amount of acid you put into your body from drinking soda, etc. They even make stuff you add to your water to alkalize it. Things like soda, obviously, and even milk although it is alkali in the container, once ingested it turns acidic and wreacks havoc on your body. Lemons, albeit acidic on the outside actually turn alkaline once ingested. You can actually look up guides to acidic and alkaline type foods. If you go to a Walgreens, health store, or wherever and pick up a roll of test strips in the health aisle, you go home, pee in a cup/container, dip the test strip in and look on the chart to see how much acid is in your body, then you take the steps necessary ...","commenter_a":"Want the cure? Eat right and use alkaline test strips until you test as alkaline as possible. Cancer feeds off the acid in the body, the more acidic you are, the better chance of the cancer spreading. If you are alkalized, cancer has nothing to feed on.","post_message":"A young woman has become the first person in the world to give birth to a healthy baby using ovarian tissue that was removed and frozen when she was still a child."}]
