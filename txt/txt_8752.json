Our thoughts and prayers are with the McDonald family. A former U.S. Navy hospital corpsman and third generation police officer, Steven McDonald was shot three times in the line of duty on July 12, 1986. The shooting left him quadriplegic. Several months after his injuries, he said that he had forgiven the 15 year-old who had shot him."},{"comment_id":"10155086722556323","commenter_b":"@username Will it be a big, beautiful wall?","commenter_a":"I can see the 'Jungle' camps with the immigrants around the NI border already :)","post_message":"Ireland prime minister has warned that avoiding a post-Brexit border is now vital for the republic national interest."},{"comment_id":"10153618680301336","commenter_b":"I don't agree with what happened to Mr Ramos but I emphatically want the illegals sent packing and our borders fortified!","commenter_a":"Moron","post_message":"ICYMI: Univision anchor Jorge Ramos told Megyn Kelly that Donald J.

Why not a background check for ammo? If gun and ammo purchasers were held responsible for keeping their weapons out of the wrong hands, we wouldn't have as as many shootings.

Make the legal purchaser responsible to ensure that anyone using the gun has passed their check.
