Thanks for keeping us strong!","post_message":"Last night, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attempted to silence not only Senator Elizabeth Warren, but the late Coretta Scott King. It was a shameful attempt to stifle the thorough debate on President Trump’s nominees that the American people expect and deserve. I applaud Senator Warren and my Democratic colleagues in the Senate for fighting on behalf of the millions of Americans who have demanded that the next U.S. Attorney General be committed to upholding our most fundamental constitutional rights. In the battles to come, both in Washington and in communities nationwide, I urge my colleagues to follow Senator Warren’s lead—as she persisted last night, so must we. We do not have the right to remain silent."},{"comment_id":"500763203381607","commenter_b":"This crap started with Clinton.

Here in Brazil we already had our first woman president, and this brought to us hope about a better country, but now she is under impeachment process due responsibility crimes made and allowed by her.
