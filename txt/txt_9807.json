So everyone is all right with him insulting women, rude comments about Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Megyn Kelly,insulted the miltary, the disabled, John Mccain just to name a few. One of the meaniest and rude things he has done where he ripped it with me is a couple of days before Thanksgiving, at a rally in South Carolina he made fun of a New York Times reporter that had a physcial problem. Speaking as a person that has a physcial problem, that was very offensive! If I would have been at that rally, I would have knocked the living crap out of Trump! Trump thinks that he is going to be able to insult himself into The White House but oh boy, he is VERY wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","post_message":"Donald J.
