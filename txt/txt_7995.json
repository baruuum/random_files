They‚Äôve been much too eager to use that gun‚Äîwe‚Äôve seen it with policing and we‚Äôve seen it with civilians. With police, first and foremost, they need to be trained and held accountable and disciplined in a way that prevents the reaction that we‚Äôve seen way too much of. And with civilians‚Äîa lot of these ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù laws need to be rewritten. If you have to defend yourself, OK. But look at some of the instances we‚Äôve had‚ÄîTrayvon Martin, and too many more. Nobody should want to create circumstances in which innocent, unarmed people are killed‚Äîeither by law enforcement or by civilians wielding guns. We‚Äôve got to figure out how to deal with that."},{"comment_id":"10156681132085354","commenter_b":"They could have a no-gravity policy, that wouldn't be real either. There are no gun-free zones in Oregon. The end.","commenter_a":"@username lies to low-information conservatives: Umpqua Community College was not a gun-free zone. No college policy overrode state law. There were students present that day with concealed weapons. The right perpetuates this lie because the truth undermines their \"it's always a gun-free zone!!\" narrative. @webpagelink","post_message":"Do YOU live in one of these 8 states? **Is #6 a little surprising?"},{"comment_id":"1375821949123925","commenter_b":"Love and agree with your comment Sandy","commenter_a":"Will not stand for the disrespect and I'm totally disgusted by the inept commissioner.
