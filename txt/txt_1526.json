You should go there when you get tired of working. Many of our jails are full of illegal immigrants waiting to be deported or just released back into society. You should really think before you open you mouth Mario. Some people are just plane dumb. To think jail or prison is a vacation. If we sent home the illegal immigrants that are currently in our jail system, we could close 20% of our jails and put that money to better use.","commenter_a":"More people would have been there but it was morning and they were sleeping. It's also not the 1st or 15th so they don't have their free government checks, so no gas to get there. I say deport them, if they are here illegally they need to go.

You have elected a Muslim President and Muslim administration twice, and sat back idly whilst a Muslim has destroyed America and flooded it with millions of Muslims and illegals. Unbelievably, after 9/11 with almost three thousand victims, America elected a Muslim, built a further 1000 mosques and sent $770 million of US tax payers money, to restore mosques overseas. Since 9/11, you have suffered a further 51 Islamic related/honour killing attacks, with another long list of victims. Millions of illegals have simply walked into America and massively include, rapists, drug users, hardened criminals and sex traffickers. Despite thousands upon thousands of unscreened Syrians entering America each month, millions of white Americans are voting a 550% increase in unscreened Muslims, amnesty to over 11 million illegals and 650 miles of open borders.
