Also if you think this is the best country in the world you must be ignoring the debt, constant war, and division of society by ethnicity, race, sex, religion etc. that is plaguing this country.

If you think this country represents the bourgeoisie elite and capitalist greed then you are right and that is why I won't support the flag not to disrespect the troops who died but to respect them because they died only for greed and American imperialism.","post_message":"Allen West Republic"}]
