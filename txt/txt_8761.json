Not because it was offensive or anything, but because it seemed to take what is clearly an issue (people taking up too much space on the subway) that can be caused by *both genders* (not just men) and acted like men were silly for thinking the ads were sexist by only targeting men. How much outrage would there be if there were a series of ads specifically targeting women for doing something that both men and women could do? Food for thought.","post_message":"\"Occupying all the territory you can is sexy.

Either way they're going to die and nobody wants to die. It's not our choice, these are foreign proteins that make our bodies suffer .

People are like cavemen and think they still have to kill to eat. I've been doing great for 20 years now without eating meat or seafood. I don't believe in killing things it's a pretty crappy thing to do. Heartless and inhumane. It's called using your brain and evolving.

I have always been pro second amendment, but maybe it is time to take a look at this from another direction. I propose we start here and see how this new gun control thing works. I propose that all people convicted of felonies be banned from owning/possessing firearms. All convicted felons should be made to turn in the guns the legally own now. Once we have all of those, lets move to people convicted of misdemeanor crimes of violence, like assault, sexual battery and so on. Lets get all those criminals that currently legally owning guns to turn those in. I figure it will take a year or so for all these people to disarm and turn in their guns and then we can see if we are having a positive impact on violent gun crimes. If so, then we can ...","commenter_a":"What don't the gun grabbers understand, if you take every gun out of every house hold we have no defense against the bad guys with the guns because they don't give a shit about the laws to start with...","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10155709379820389","commenter_b":"Let ISIS continue to take these worthless countries and killing all the cowards.
