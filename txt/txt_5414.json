I used to watch it at my Granny's house every Saturday. @webpagelink","commenter_a":"Racism is an intentional act. This is not racism. Just because it sounds the same does not make it a slur on Pakistani's in any way shape or form. It's a different spelling with a different meaning entirely. whomever started this nonsense needs to be kicked in the butt for trying to stir up trouble.","post_message":"The WHAT are out of containment?"},{"comment_id":"10156625671370354","commenter_b":"Dork....","commenter_a":"He's a black man who don't no shit about running a country","post_message":"“I’m a black man who sometime wears his hat on backwards,” Obama said.

The borders should have been closed a long time ago, illegals need to go, refugees need to find another country to bleed for free stuff. I am so sick of the politically correct government we have now, none of them have common sense. After 9-11 we should have turned that place into a parking lot just like we did to Japan during ww2.","commenter_a":"Anyone who plans on voting for that lying, cheating, snake called hillary just needs to stay home. She should be on her way to prison for the email scandal and benghazzi. This proves that government is fixed. Besides nobody wants to see bill again ( he don't even know what sex is).","post_message":"Michelle Obama says she wants a president who knows issues \"cannot be boiled down to 140 characters.\""},{"comment_id":"895415013919526","commenter_b":"Now that her husband's term as President is closer to end, she should not have spoken like that. She had known before she moved with her husband and daughters that she woukd wake up in the house built by slaves.","commenter_a":"Reading these comments reveals why we're stuck as a nation on racial issues. There are a lot of black people who refuse to acknowledge we're no longer in 1955 and their shortcomings are primarily their own (the Obamas are not in that camp, by the way); and there are a lot of white people in stark denial of our nation's less than glorious past. And do people even read articles before they post their drivel? The First Lady was praising America for our progress, not looking down on the nation. Get a grip, people.","post_message":"Michelle Obama gave her last commencement speech as first lady at the City College of New York."},{"comment_id":"10158409138265725","commenter_b":"Now we know why she's bitter and single","commenter_a":"I can't believe she told that woman that her husband was cheating on her!!!!

If she can feel remorse for people shot by cops but not cops shot by people she's just a horrible person. Own it and don't try to dance around it by saying you feel guilty when you don't, I'd respect that more.","post_message":"“I am dealing with a bit of guilt because I don’t feel sad for the officers that lost their lives and I know that’s not really my heart,” James said in the video."}]
