I hope that you will agree that the system has removed a majority of our \"Black\" men who would physically engage in battle with the injustices. They are being removed from society and that weakens us as a people. They are imprisoned for a greater length of time, killed in unlawful ways right in our faces (bullets in the back, strangled and held by more than one, ect...). A great majority of our women are now out and about alone and really can not defend themselves physically against the powers that be!
