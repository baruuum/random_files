So, I do agree with you just never heard of known a Canadian to come here just to have a baby.","commenter_a":"look people. If you come to this country legally, doing all the appropriate paerwork and forms, any kids you have that are born here will be American Citizens. That won't change. What we want to change is the Anchor Baby tourism that flourishes on the West Coast, with the Asian women travelling here on 'vacation' to have their babaies in specially marketed motels just for them, so that their children, and them by association many times, would be American Citizens. And those illegal immigrants who cross our northern and southern border, from a multitude of countries, who break the law by sneaking in like a thief in the night, who have their babies here hoping for the chance to stay with them. People should not be rewarded fro breaking a law.","post_message":"With a renewed conversation challenging birthright citizenship, a look back at the 1898 case that first established the legal precedent in the U.S."},{"comment_id":"10154523076746028","commenter_b":"Milo is trash","commenter_a":"And most of you laugh when our president calls all of the BS networks and papers \"fake news\"!","post_message":"Eek."},{"comment_id":"484282168429030","commenter_b":"deport her and all the rest of the muslims in america","commenter_a":"Yes","post_message":"She walked on the plane wearing her Hijab, boy was that a mistake.
