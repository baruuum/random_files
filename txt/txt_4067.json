It's not only Africa's problem this is a world wide issue. Next time you hear a piano play or go to the pub to play some billiards question what they are made of. Ivory poaching legally ended in 1989, but the demand will always be there and countries like China and Japan will always buy their way through these bans as long as we keep buying tacky souvenirs from Asia containing Ivory. Education is the key, we have to take an interest and ask what is the item I'm about to purchase made from? This is what we can do to reduce the demand of items made from threatened species.","post_message":"Poachers, beware.

If Defunded..the government funding would simply be re-allocating taxpayer dollars to approximately 13,500 Women's Health centers across the country, (ones who actually own a mammogram machine & provide prenatal care, & ambulatory care--which PP does not do at all.) Planned Parenthood is breaking the law: delivering 2nd term babies to cut the organs out for resale & killing them outside the womb. If you have not watched the videos (exposing this on film), then you are being negligent of the truth. Plus PP helps Human Traffickers & pays cover up millions for mothers deaths on the abortion table. Women deserve better.
