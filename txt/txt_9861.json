Unfortunately we all probably knew this was the case even before reading the story. I'll be shouted down by Pit defenders as is their norm, but I don't care. No other breed is killing other dogs and humans like this, and this breed needs a re-set NOW.","post_message":"A French bulldog puppy that died after being attacked by another dog while in the care of a Petco-owned dog-boarding facility has prompted calls for #justiceforboggs.  The Pooch Hotel Hollywood representatives initially told the dog's owner that Boggs was taken to a vet as a precaution after an altercation, according to the owner's roommate. About 45 minutes later, an ER vet called to say the puppy was in critical condition with a torn trachea and multiple internal injuries.   Described as \"13 pounds of pure joy,\" Boggs was put down as her out-of-town owner listened helplessly on the phone. Now she is considering legal action.

How can something that provides the best source of nutrients for a baby be considered too obscene to be observed in public where as men's which are just another body part be considered fine?! Free the nipple doesn't require a woman to bear all. I won't be, I've had no reason either functionally or otherwise to display mine in public (it's a bit cold in this part of the world) but my body is not obscene. I totally support the women doing this. If nipples are so provocative it's the sexualisation that society places on women not the female nipple owners that are the problem.","post_message":"\"It has to be said that, to the casual observer, the #FreeTheNipple campaign is a very confusing thing. Let’s just get this straight, one might say, it’s a feminist movement that encourages toplessness, and which has led to an Icelandic MP, respected as a serious parliamentarian, getting her boobs out for everyone to see. And you’re telling me this is one in the eye for the patriarchy?\""},{"comment_id":"10153935429529726","commenter_b":"That motherfucker is insane.

And so where the bigoted bakers, Faith is not an excuse to treat others poorly. You say murder is never okay yet both books are full of it. You are intolerant of both the bible and the Koran. Yet you somehow think a bigoted bakers faith is an excuse? That's a double standards","commenter_a":"The intolerance level for religion on this thread is too dang high! Get yourselves together. If you're going to claim \"BE TOLERANT\" to things, you gotta be tolerant to religion also. They will always exist. There will always be someone or some thing to worship or praise. Spirituality is a great thing. It brings positivity to people's lives. There's nothing wrong with that.","post_message":"But the story isn't as simple as nature versus religion, experts say."}]
