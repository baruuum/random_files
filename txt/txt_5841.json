Someone with a little logic about the abortion! It should not be tax payer funded and it should NoT be past 12 weeks and it should not be used just because some idiot woman didn't use birth control and doesn't wanna deal with the consequences of her actions !","commenter_a":"I can not believe that abortion is a right to be discussed in 2016. It is a womans right to decide! It is our bodies!! As long as it happens before the 12th week...but women need to use their head and not use this as birthcontrol! Protect yourself if you don't want a kid! As I said, it is 2016 and we do have many types of birthcontrol!","post_message":"Obama's last stand"},{"comment_id":"10152694778793717","commenter_b":"Colebrook....-38","commenter_a":"Berlin -22","post_message":"We're looking for your best guesses for the coldest spot overnight tonight in New Hampshire.

The people that make it possible for illegals to get driver's license are the same people who refuse to correct the laws that allow career criminals to run the streets killing cops and our children.","commenter_a":"How about we stop issuing drivers licenses to people that have broken the law and are here illegally? Blaming the current governor for this is absolute stupidity. Blame Richardson and the democrats in Santa Fe, this is all on them!","post_message":"The most logical way to comply with the REAL ID law is for the Governor to agree to a bipartisan plan for a two-tier driverâ€™s license in New Mexico. Republicans and Democrats in the state Senate crafted a compromise last session that would have resolved this issue. The Governor should agree to that compromise. This will address concerns about public safety, meet the requirements of the REAL ID law, and assure that New Mexicans can continue to access federal facilities and airports. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1390819424294656","commenter_b":"Esta es la barbaridad de el aborto La Nina nacio viva, y la dejaron morir.Dios va a traer juicio , sobre todos los que derraman sangre inocente.","commenter_a":"That's not an abortion,that's disgraceful","post_message":""}]
