Twice!!! He then gets in trouble because, as most 6 year old boys, he gets out of his seat and wiggles all day. But the kicker is what he's fed! Sugar sugar sugar for school breakfast! He's even come home and told me he had a freaking pop tart! What the crap! Then he's punished for their stupidity. Schools need to lay off the sugar, and allow for atleast 20 minutes for recess. I vote for 20 mins twice a day. My son would be SO much better for his teacher! (Oh, and I agree with many comments....get rid of this common core crap! It's just that....CRAP!!!)","post_message":"Do you think that Florida elementary schools should be required to provide 20 minutes of recess every day?"},{"comment_id":"10153370094858010","commenter_b":"Yeah she really wants equal money lol your dumb lady","commenter_a":"It is the American nightmare regarding the death of our middle class and deeper poverty to our poor and elders.

Illegals shouldn't be voting. Lets crack down on cheating. voter ID.","commenter_a":"So now conservatives have to worry about the huge amount of Latinos who will vote Democrat in the 2016 elections, just because Trump voiced the truth about those coming here illegally. We have over a year to go before a candidate is chosen, giving the criminals who came over the border illegally plenty of time to change the minds of Americans.","post_message":"These days, Donald Trump seems to be at the center of every controversy.
