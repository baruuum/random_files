Not only was this guy scoping out gay bars before, he also chose to go on Latinx night, when most of the patrons were PoC, generally of Latin descent. So this was a hate crime. It had to do with race, it had to do with sexual orientation. You trying to bury those facts is deplorable.","commenter_a":"This isn't a gay attack. It's a terrorist attack that's being portrayed as homophobic because that's a cause people will rally for. Anything to further your agenda. No one wants to believe it's radical Islam, but that's what this is. Of course his family and even his own tweets blame gays. A gay bar is a perfect target so we can blame homophobes and call it a a hate crime. Well terror is also a hate crime and gay or straight these people are dead.","post_message":"President Obama on Sunday morning's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.
