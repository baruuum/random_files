Kids tested? Gwah lordy be. What a generation of pansies..","commenter_a":"There are ways to pin this abuse on this bitch. The father has to use some tactics to have the courts on his side. I would get the kids psychologically evaluated, have them testify in court in regards to the mother's abuse and a list of other stuff.

The C Level staff walk away with millions and everyone else has to suck it up.","post_message":"What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he was going to stand up for working people it turns out that Wall Street and Goldman Sachs are still running the show - and the Trump administration. Among many other billionaires in the Trump administration is Gary D. Cohn, the departing president of Goldman Sachs and Trump's new director of the National Economic Council. Upon leaving Goldman Sachs, Cohn just received an exit package of $285 million. Yes, $285 million.  And that's how the rigged economy and oligarchy works. The middle class of this country bailed out Goldman Sachs to the tune of over $800 billion. Goldman Sachs paid a $5 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury for illegal activity, as did virtually every other major bank. Meanwhile, no top Wall Street executive is prosecuted for criminal activity. Instead, the president of Goldman Sachs becomes the leading financial adviser to the President. And, to add insult to injury, Cohn and the Trump administration will soon end up supporting huge tax breaks for the rich while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Can we stop them? Yes. But only through a powerful and focused grassroots movement which tells Congress to represent us all, not just the 1 percent."},{"comment_id":"1772923492974110","commenter_b":"'@username .. Tippu tip, one of the greatest slave traders known to man that had over 10,000 slaves in Zanzibar, grandmother was a muslim slave. The problem with islam is the contradictions. You inherit the greatness of your lineage as well as all of the ills. The first step for Muslims to get passed this & be accepted in the international community is to accept the past for what it is & stop lying, deflecting, & manipulating it. It only creates more RAGE! Everything in this video is FACT and supported with 100's of years of abundant evidence. This video is actually a low ball. The actual number of victims of islamic genocide s 100 - 150 million deaths. Please stop telling me about 'bilal' that was a slave in the first place by an arab. Abu bakr freed 3 personal pagan slaves for bilal's emancipation. Am I suppose to ...","commenter_a":"This is the blind teaching the blind. A ratings based media hub focusing on the impulses of the ignorant. This is not accurate about Muslims and therefore makes it inaccurate of Arabs. All Arabs aren't white. There was a black Arab named TIPPU TIP, he was one of the biggest contributers to slavery. He was very black. Look him up. Also, a Arab can't teach islam. Because Islam isn't synonymous with Arabs, it's more wide spread with Asians. Indonesia is the largest population of Muslims. All Arabs aren't muslim. And there were many Arabs who rejected Prophet Muhammed. I love history but I hate when people try to each topics of sensitive topics but pose a biased view. Black people must realize we are not all the same. Americans aren't the same a all Africans. We know why we're African, but most don't know we're more American than the white ...","post_message":"10 Facts About The Arab Enslavement Of Black People Not Taught In Schools"},{"comment_id":"1157488834340407","commenter_b":"I thought she was leaving.
