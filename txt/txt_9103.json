Only feminists are evil...","commenter_a":"Abortion was legal by common law we brought with us from England at the very beginning of this country, the 1600's, women could abort up until quickening using herbs, falls, punches to the stomach, abortion potions were big business and freely advertised. The Founders did nothing to change this either. Try Googling the history of abortion in the US.","post_message":"Pretty much."},{"comment_id":"1675801449377863","commenter_b":"Better yet: Buh bye racist ahole!","commenter_a":"Buh bye, racist!","post_message":"Serves him right."},{"comment_id":"10153254096516509","commenter_b":"Send her to India","commenter_a":"I hope they capture her alive and she spends the rest of her days rotting in prison.

Why dont people know grography?

Just don't think Hillary is deserving .","commenter_a":"Sorry, but it is time,long over due for a woman to start running this country. Look at the other countries that are run by women, get smart and vote Hillary Clinton in, she is very smart and she has Bill with her. So Bill had a woman under his desk,who cares. He wasn't sexually frustrated,if only the last 3 presidents had a woman under his desk,we would have a better run country. Now I'm not saying men should cheat, but a blow job from some stupid ass hussey, wouldn't hurt.","post_message":"It's time. Thank you, Winning Democrats!"}]
