She broke into his house, they WERE engaged but not living together, and she stole $2.1 MILLION worth of jewelry. And this stuff happened AFTER he paid off her house and bought her a business, (just a nail salon).

Just because Mr Trump doesn't lean to the 'far' right, doesn't mean he's not a Republican! I don't lean to the 'far' right, but I am a Republican! It's time for some real middle of the road compromising - more real and true policies will get passed and the stagnant economy, security, and the best welfare of Americans will come to fruition!
