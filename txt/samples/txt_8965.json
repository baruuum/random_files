You said it before I finished my statement.","commenter_a":"It's very obvious what happened here, it has been right from the start. This plane was intentionally driven into the ground by one of the pilots on the plane. This was very clearly a suicide/mass murder. Sadly, this is not the first time a pilot on a major airline has done this either. We are going to need to start doing a FAR better job of digging deep into the backgrounds of the pilots that we entrust to fly our major airliners going forward now. Or, we are going to have to start piloting these planes remotely from the ground and only using on-board pilots as a back-up in case the remote piloting system fails for some reason.","post_message":"A bit of eerie evidence has turned up on the cockpit voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that crashed into the French Alps this week."}]
