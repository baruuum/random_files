I remember so clearly Michelle's remarks at 44 years of age saying it was the first time she had been proud to be an American, I was shocked beyond words! To accept so much as we are given as Americans and not to be thankful and proud of our country and our fellow everyday wonderful citizens, Americans! Color or religion are immaterial, Americans and I for one am so thankful for being one and never fail to appreciate what it is to be American. Thank you Judge Pirro for your concise evaluation of Michelle Obama.","post_message":"In the final days before the Obamas leave the White House, Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro just gave Michelle a parting gift she'll NEVER forget."},{"comment_id":"10154209285520969","commenter_b":"Madeline why then, where we're your masses in Nov.
