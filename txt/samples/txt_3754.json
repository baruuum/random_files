But they also learn about the dangers of smoking and drinking at age 13 (give or take a year) in mandatory health class yet can't smoke or drink till 18(now 21) and 21? The logic is just weird.","commenter_a":"Why is it that we don't let people smoke till 18 and drink till 21(both of which mainly affect their own health) yet we trust teenagers as young as 15 and a half to drive a vehicle with the potential to kill others?

Reality check: the EGYPTIANS -- not the Jews -- decided to build the pyramids for the pharaoh's graves -- NOT to store grain!  “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,” Carson said. “Now all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain. And when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they’d have to be that way for a reason.”  Read more here: @webpagelink Video by Occupy Democrats, LIKE our page for more!"},{"comment_id":"10153202617203690","commenter_b":"Stupid girls!!","commenter_a":"We must ask ourselves why and find the antidote.
