Teachers are now reporting a sharp rise in bullying and rude talking out and racist comments directed at other children after Trump began his campaign. If you are acting like an idiotic, alt-right Trump supporter at home, your children are seeing and hearing this and thinking this is how people should act. Stop it now!

There's a difference between protesters and violent rioters! Stand there with your picket signs! And speak your mind but stay out of an arena full of supporters who came to hear Trump speak! This is a travesty of the 1st amendment! No one in the media even shows and exposes the idiocy and rhetoric espoused at BLM movements where they threaten to assault or kill police!
