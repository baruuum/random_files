NOT THE CHURCH. THAT IS SACRED, which tells me one thing about these evil people: THEY WANT TO DESTROY RIGHTEOUSNESS and anyone who stands for it. 36 states have already told them they could marry, but NO, now they will force righteous Pastors, Priests, etc. to marry them and there will be conscientious objectors standing up against it.
