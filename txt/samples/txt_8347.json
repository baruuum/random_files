Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully and fairly enforce the law.   Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have. There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly and clearly: This is just the beginning.   If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while Donald Trump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us. If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism, and bigotry into the Justice Department, he'll hear from all of us. And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into the Justice Department will hear from all of us, too.   Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist."},{"comment_id":"1662251920662029","commenter_b":"White thugs!!","commenter_a":"Love the broncos, but just for this I would have they're title taken from them and given to the panthers","post_message":"This is disappointing.
