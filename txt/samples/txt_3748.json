Irony received. 😉","commenter_a":"White supremacist exist whether as paramilitary, or the idiotic Trump supporter who thinks he owns everything and everybody telling a Hispanic American (Jorge Ramos) to go back where he came from, to people who will destroy other cultures way of life for a dollar because they have no respect for others. They are so pervasive the only way to resist them is for people of color to band together. To pretend white supremacist don't exist or that they will magically disappear is to ensure their continued control over our lives. Working together to overcome an evil is not anti-American, it's just common sense.","post_message":"Fighting White Supremacists: Don't Forget, We Are In It Together!  @webpagelink"}]
