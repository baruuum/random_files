Look at how many WHITE HATE GROUPS that exist. A lot of them have the word AMERICAN in their names. Some of them you probably don't even know they are considered HATE GROUPS. Only 2 black hate groups are listed and BLM is not one of them. The fact that you harp on on BLM just shows you are ignorant. Why don't you focus on the NUMEROUS WHITE HATE GROUPS???

Maybe if you and people like you concentrated on fixing your HATEFUL and RACIST THINKING then racism and discrimination wouldn't exist and the BLM would have no reason to be.
