You don't know what you're talking about so you're automatically excluded. @username I agree it could be seen as sexist except I am a female and bake all the time, but MORE IMPORTANTLY Men are known to be the best chefsðŸ˜‰. @username she didn't make any valid point when she stated \"nothing new, threats made against students daily\" She's out of touch with the article and with reality if she is trying to compare unspecified kids being threatened to a RACIST threatening to kill only BLACK KIDS posing with ak47 on the school grounds!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!??? The generalization she attached to this comment is uncanny, disturbing, and I'm sorry RACIST in an of itself. Because the DENIAL of racism IS racism also.","commenter_a":"This is nothing new. Threats are made against students daily!

You think all that is fair for us to pay the bills of someone illegally sneaking across our boarder or overstaying there visa. How many Americans have been murdered or robbed or raped by them? Far to many!","commenter_a":"Everyone are immigrants to US America .... Okay!!!!!!","post_message":"Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate"},{"comment_id":"794164403965442","commenter_b":"F%%+ white people !!!","commenter_a":"This is why I hate white people!!!","post_message":"In an update to our previous coverage; ASU Police Officer Stewart Ferrin's administrative leave has been extended.

Women have come too far to regress back to this BS! (That goes for Orthodox Jews, Islam, & Christian nuns.) Little girls all over the world: your body is not shameful! You do not need to be modest to lessen the desires of men or a masculine God! You are beautiful in all of your natural glory!","post_message":"She also does comic book characters and Kardashians."},{"comment_id":"10153963536777235","commenter_b":"And a large percentage of illegal immigrants simply come here legally with a visa and just don't leave.","commenter_a":"The wall is absolutely absurd. See the ocean? You can use it to go around the big ugly wall. See the airplanes? You can go over the wall. Ask El Chappo about going under things. It's nostril flaringly stupid. Ancient technology. Pre airplane, backhoe and no ocean on either side. It would be funny if there weren't so many truly stupid people believing it.

In short, White people are starved for heroes, but Black people have chosen villains for their heroes, and feed their souls on poison. And what people of any age can rise above their heroes?","post_message":"Four out of 10 African-Americans said they doubt the nation will ever achieve racial equality, but as many white Americans believe racial equality has been achieved, according to a national study released by the Pew Research Center (From PBS NewsHour)"}]
