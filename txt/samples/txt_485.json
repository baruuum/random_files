The only reason they gave back access is because a court battle over this would have revealed to the public that every democratic campaign had access to those records, and when the Sanders campaign reported it, nothing was done.

I see a lot of people on there saying to \"Stop calling me!\" yet don't leave their number. Yes, I'm tired of the \"Lower Your Credit Card Interest\" or letting me know about a topical pain ointment.
