First, the pictures weren't taken outside of the US, they were taken here. So the argument that they \"could have been taken outside of the country\" doesn't hold weight. Second, yes, models come here and do photoshoots \"all the time\", however, as the article states, there is a way to do it legally, and a way to do it illegally/fraudulently. From her own statements, it seems there might be a case where it was done wrong. And lastly, it does matter because Trump's platform is \"do it the right way, she did it the right way\", and if she didn't do it the right way, then it is yet another lie and makes them hypocrites. I realize she isn't running, but he is so he made this an issue.

Unless there's a time machine, people can have their own thought who built the pyramids in what year, and for what purpose....

Reality check: the EGYPTIANS -- not the Jews -- decided to build the pyramids for the pharaoh's graves -- NOT to store grain!  ‚ÄúMy own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,‚Äù Carson said. ‚ÄúNow all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs‚Äô graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain. And when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they‚Äôd have to be that way for a reason.‚Äù  Read more here: @webpagelink Video by Occupy Democrats, LIKE our page for more!"},{"comment_id":"448351221956139","commenter_b":"I'm from Texas and Perry has done a good job for jobs and everything else, except shutting the border down.
