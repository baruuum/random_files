Please.","commenter_a":"I hope you all understand that because the prosecutor went for a murder charge, this officer will be found not guilty. One, due to the fact that the prosecution will have to prove that an on duty officer was out there to kill someone, which won't happen. Two, for the fact that a vehicle is a deadly weapon and shooting a suspect using a vehicle in a manner that puts an officers life in danger is standard procedure and is taught in every academy in the U.S. This was a good shoot and the officer will be exonerated. But get ready to torch your local cvs for justice.","post_message":" is without question a murder, the prosecutor said about Sam Dubose's death.  didn do anything violent toward the officer. He wasn dragging him. And [the officer] pulled out his gun and shot him in the head."},{"comment_id":"10152606580602434","commenter_b":"The \"greedy bitch\" is a man.","commenter_a":"Getting married doesn't automatically entitle you to gifts or money, your guests will give what they can, if they can but surely their attendance is more important than receiving things from them? This is the most jacked up article I've read in a long time, far too much misdirected vitriol. Hope this greedy bitch gets nothing! Equating the whole situation of gift/money giving to 'living in sin' is so ridiculous and the amount of times people are directly cursed out is excessive. If you wanted to express your opinion so badly, you should have learned how to write first. Bridezilla!","post_message":"These people often fall in the same group as elitist jerks who think getting a dress from David's Bridal is \"tacky.\""},{"comment_id":"1131244553635264","commenter_b":"#BernieOrBust #BernieAllTheWay #DropOutHillary","commenter_a":"Either way it will be a Democrat all the way to the White House again for another eight years along with a Democratic majority in Congress!

He doesn't know policy, he doesn't think ahead, and he stumbles when it comes to content. Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz. I write such because the thought of Trump facing Hillary in debate makes me cringe. Kasich, the newest favorite of the GOP, cannot win. I love my home state, but Ohio doesn't save Kasich from toppling.","post_message":"Not budging."}]
