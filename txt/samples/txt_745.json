Every time I was called that I retaliated. Im not a thug or a criminal. The teacher has to respect the students and vice versa. In hindsight the student should have went to the principal and then to his parents. Im in no way condoning what the student did but its a 2 way street. Dont bash the student when we dont know exactly what rhe teacher said. Racial slurs or any other forms of racism has no place in society. My kids or the kids I coach cant even say anything like that. Either way whatever was said isn't the problem. It was the lack of respect from the teacher and STUDENT.","commenter_a":"@username you say teachers need to watch what they say. I don't get it. What about the child. Dosen't he need to be taught. I don't like what you said so I punch you. There are other ways of handling verbal abuse. This is disgraceful.","post_message":"Witnesses say a Prince George's County Schools student punched his teacher over a racially insensitive comment: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"370042553184039","commenter_b":"marriage was not meant to be a shitty relationship depends have a market I would like to invest","commenter_a":"evolution and same sex cannot coexist","post_message":"POLL: God's design for marriage?
