Chriss you happened to get a job that you get assigned a vehicle can anybody come tell you what and how. You're a smart man. You might get a job that requires you to move out of the state or even the country. That job comes with all expenses paid for four years including the house and the car. You tell me who can come in there and disrespect you. Not even the ceo or cfo of that company can do that without proper protocol. You had to move your family. And your doing your best job.

I'm no scientitian, but it seems to me it's a helluva coincidence (that we take for granted) that the female menstrual cycle is in line with the lunar cycle. Our bodies are 2/3rds water and the moon controls the tides. Am I talking out my ass if I suggest maybe the moon can can influence the fluids in our bodies? So on a dfferent planet, with different moons (and presumably after having been there for several generations), would women cycle differently?","post_message":""}]
