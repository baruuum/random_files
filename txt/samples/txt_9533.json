Where she says, \"I considered myself a feminist before it was cool, now everyone is claiming it?\" She said that a while ago. First, tell that to Gloria Steinem, honey. Second, I think it's not really feminism when one woman decides to deride another because she decides that she's not doing it right? Yeah, no. Sorry.

There's a difference between protesters and violent rioters! Stand there with your picket signs! And speak your mind but stay out of an arena full of supporters who came to hear Trump speak! This is a travesty of the 1st amendment! No one in the media even shows and exposes the idiocy and rhetoric espoused at BLM movements where they threaten to assault or kill police! Or threaten and degrade black officers maintaining the peace. This is ridiculous! All of these protesters won't have enough time to protest when Trump is in office because they'll be put back to work!","post_message":"#BREAKING: As Donald Trump comes under fire for escalating violence at his rallies, video shows police in Kansas City, Mo., using pepper spray against protesters.
