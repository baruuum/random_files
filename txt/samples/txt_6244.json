The few elite own the few corporations and all are subjects of the foreign owned NON \"federal\" reserve! GOVT benefits were advertised south of the border. The border is not secure. Enforcing US deportation laws are ordered on STANDING DOWN. An increasing invasion of illegal foreigners flock into our nation. So now, the govt is offering huge tax rebates to illegals never having paid taxes! I give up! America can never survive.","commenter_a":"NO I DO NOT AGREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","post_message":"PETITION HERE: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10156070915820354","commenter_b":"We all know what Jorge Ramos is full of !!","commenter_a":"No, sir you are a loud mouth rude, obnoxious piece of shit!","post_message":"Reporter?

Keep that bitch far away from us!","commenter_a":"Katrina Pierson should be in Milwaukee or Georgia. The media is paid to review everything Trump said and to soil it. They don't care about the real news, another cop assassinated through race- baiting rhetoric from Obama and HRC. Milwaukee is rioting. The streets of Chicago are still killing fields. Clinton is racketeering money through the foundation in pay for play schemes. Yet Ms Pierson has only one thing to do on this Sunday. Find dirt on what Trump said and exploit it. Is this the kind of values we should accept from these UnAmerican sewer-valued people?","post_message":"Did you ever hear of a \"novelty tradition\" in politics?"}]
