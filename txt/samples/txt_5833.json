This was a comment from a woman named Laura Johnson who posted on TYT thread, and I thought it was worth the share. When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting ...","post_message":"In a wide-ranging interview with FoxNews, President Obama says he failed to adequately plan for the day after the U.S. helped toppled Libya's dictator in 2011."},{"comment_id":"1195181073877040","commenter_b":"Kick her ass out","commenter_a":"What does Jesus tell us about judging others.

What is this crazy world comming to? EVERY BODY KNOWS she is GUILTY as SIN!!!:-(:-(:-(","post_message":">> Sign the petition and tell the DOJ Hillary isn't above the law: @webpagelink  Today the FBI announced Hillary Clinton violated classified procedures, carelessly and recklessly endangered national security - and had done so repeatedly, over 100 times.   The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage and the rule of law has been turned upside down.  This weekend, we learned former President Clinton met with the Obama Administration Attorney general - the FBI director's boss - in private.   Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.  The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. People have gone to jail for less severe breaches of classified information and national security.    Today Director Comey and the Obama Administration Department of Justice made it clear to the American people, and all those being unfairly prosecuted by the DOJ, that there is no accountability, no justice, and the Clintons are allowed to live by a different set of rules.   This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans' faith in the justice system."},{"comment_id":"1810739472541280","commenter_b":"Recount!! Recount!! Go girl!
