The Ukraine government was propped up by the Russian government at the time Manafort was dealing with them. It was Russian/Soviet Union weaponry that took the life of a cousin in Vietnam. I'm a veteran from the Reagan era and broke out in a cold sweat every time general quarters was sounded thinking Russia/Soviet Union had finally attacked us. From the day I first opened my eyes Russia/Soviet Union was my country's enemy. Today's Russian government mirrors the government of my former enemy and the GOP candidate praises their leadership and hints that we should crawl in bed with them...I THINK NOT!!!!!","commenter_a":"Well, this is not news; Dumbocrats support rigged elections not the popular support.

How many IEDs are you avoiding on your way to the grocery store? I know we all know on any given day we could face gunfire from our neighbors from all different Christian faiths. If anything you're much more likely to be attacked in the U.S. by an angry Christian than by any other group of faith. The by the number argument that you're safer over seas from terrorist attacks than at home in the U.S. is based on comparing thousands of attacks on militarized institutions over seas and a small number of attacks directed at low security military institutions & personnel in the U.S. I feel for our solders at home being attacked. Just as I mourn for those children being attack in schools around our country. The people in the malls ...","commenter_a":"\"Radical Muslims are now the rule, not the exception\".... Let's talk about this. The Muslim faith has the largest number of believers in a world full of different faiths. To consider turning against all Muslims quite literally means to turn against over a billion people. She said this was the 21st attack. So roughly 21 people of the millions of Muslims living in the U.S. are radicals. I'm no math wiz but that sounds like an extremely small percentage. Secondly, Christians around the world have killed millions of people in the name of a God that most Americans demand our president to believe in. Who are the real radicals? Continuing, a soldier serving/living in the Middle East is absolutely not more safe there from terrorist attacks than one living in the U.S. That comment should be heard clearly as one of the dumbest things ever said.
