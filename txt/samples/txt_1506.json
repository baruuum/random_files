That means more than just picnics and sales and the start of summer.  It’s a time to offer tribute, prayers and thanks to the heroic men and women of America’s military who for over two centuries have laid down their lives to protect our freedoms.    But we should also remember the many wounded warriors who survived the battles, but came home with deep and lasting scars.  They deserve the very best care we can give them.  Not only through the Veterans Administration, but through private aid groups, like K9s For Warriors.  It’s a non-profit group that provides service dogs to vets with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities, to help them return to civilian life with independence and dignity.  100 percent of individual donations go to the program.  And 95 percent of the service dogs they train are rescued from shelters.  So when you donate to them, you don’t just help a veteran, you save a dog, too. Talk about doubling your money!  To learn more, go online to K9sForWarriors.org."},{"comment_id":"10153204026980090","commenter_b":"I will NEVER EVER forget her saying \" What Difference at this point does it make\" Americans died Hillary don't you get it?","commenter_a":"FOUR MOTHERS, that's Mothers, NOT MILLIONS, that's The Difference Hillary it's Time to get Right with God, you will be glad all through out Eternity!!!","post_message":"Hillary Clinton still owes us answers.
