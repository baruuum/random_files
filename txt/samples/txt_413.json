Building a wall will do absolutely nothing for illegal immigration and drug trafficking other than to satisfy the small minority of Americans who voted for Trump. The tax payers will have dole out billions to build this \"wall\" without benefit. You can't even call this a viable \"infrastructure\" project. I do agree with deporting illegal criminal offenders and would go even further by deporting criminals with legal but non-permanent status. Not only from Mexico but anywhere. Ireland, Israel, Africa, etc...","commenter_a":"Isolationism does have consequences.","post_message":"This afternoon, President Donald J.

Given the fight Fonda now has against North American oil discovery and transportation, she has once again aided and abetted the enemy: Islamic oil producers. It seems Jihadi Jane neither understands how her actions are viewed by the enemy (major Muslim oil exporters, some of whose core members want to see the destruction of the United States) nor how these anti-jobs protests impact hundreds of thousands of North American families. @webpagelink"}]
