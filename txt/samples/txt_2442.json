There are '100,000 empty fully air conditioned tents' in Mina- Saudi Arabia capable of housing 3 million people yet Saudi Arabia refuses to take the refugees, who speaks same language, same culture, same tradition, same religion, yet Saudi Arabia feels it's 'a security risks to accept the refugees' but wants the Christian world to do so? I'm trying to understand this thing called 'common sense', how it's been used. Is Saudi Arabia not too wicked for turning it's back against its own? Why blaming the US?
