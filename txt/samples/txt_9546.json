The number ending up at Calais is miniscule, the article also states most don't even know about our benefit system so maybe we left behind a massive impression after colonising half the world they figure we are the country they admire or can relate to, to be honest i don't care, if its they live or die then they should live here","commenter_a":"Those people in calais are not true refugees or asylum seekers, if they where, they would claim fir asylum in france. EU law says that they should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Last time I checked, france is a safe country, so is spain, italy, germany, and many other eu countries. What I don't understand is why there are over 5,000 of these so called asylum seekers camping in calais trying to get into the uk. If you are a genuine asylum seeker, you don't get to pick and choose where you want to live.","post_message":"When you’re facing the world’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, it helps to have a sober debate about how to respond. But to do that, you need facts and data – two things that the British migration debate has lacked this summer.  These, in the clearest terms, are the 10 key facts."},{"comment_id":"10153712175233352","commenter_b":"So it would be ok to throw down in front of a toddler is that what you are saying? She should have put her down for what huh, for what? Get some sense in your head !! The only guilty party is the lil bitch who hit the girl holding a child she is a straight up coward and thats probably the only reason she hit her cause her hands were full!","commenter_a":"I think all parties are guilty the ones egging it on the mother of the child and her friend. Her friend seen what was going on so she should have taken the baby and the mother... Should have put the baby down as she see the girl kept saying put the baby down and appeared not to give a dam. Believe me all parties played their part in the hatred or what ever that got them to this point. In reality the mother used her child as a pawn thinking it would have saved her from a ass whooping putting her child in danger. Thank God the female was caught and the baby is ok. They all need to get it together... Because believe they all full of shit and played a roll in this fight...","post_message":"Texas girl, 13, who was caught on camera as she launched brutal assault on rival teen holding a toddler is now in police custody"},{"comment_id":"1097247357003041","commenter_b":"Bitch please","commenter_a":"These cops did nothing wrong.
