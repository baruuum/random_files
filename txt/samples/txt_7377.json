Majority of the military that protects this country is Southern. People think they can just so publicly shit on us for something they know nothing about. Let me tell you something my family has been there for generations they had no slaves had to bust their asses having their children working hard picking cotton and corn using wood stoves until the damn 70s.

Well probably not since another leak talks about how you in the media and donna Brazile help her by giving her question that will be asked in the debates with Bernie, so she could memorise her answers. Hemmmm ,poor Bernie. They even told her when to smile. But guess you won't be report this becuase you're as guilty as she is. What a shame that we can no longer trust the media, the FBI, and of course lying bigoted hillary.
