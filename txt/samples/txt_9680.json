(In my case grandchildren). This testing bs in today's teaching in beyond rediculous. The \"common core\" math is crazy. My 12 yr old grandson just got a low grade in math and son in law said he doesn't understand it. There are mire letters than numbers in his math class. He is getting what we had in advanced 12th grade and it is just too difficult for that age to understand and too busy testing for tests to see what he doesn't understand. I pitty Florida kids in public school. Something needs to change before we lose more teachers like this. Please start teaching our kids to love learning and let our kids learn to love learning.","post_message":"A Polk County teacher recently resigned, citing what she calls 'educational malpractice,' resulting from too much standardized testing:"},{"comment_id":"10155027837294411","commenter_b":"I am trying to learn you that you can't blame a whole religion on the wrongdoing of one person..

Two years ago, I joined with officials from across our region as Caterpillar announced its intention to expand its footprint and keep its headquarters in Peoria â€“ so this news comes as a shock. Our local economy is tied to the success of Caterpillar. My hope is that Caterpillar will keep the promise it made today for Peoria to remain its largest manufacturing site. I stand with all Peorians in expressing my deep disappointment with this decision."},{"comment_id":"10153563067675667","commenter_b":"@username Americans are seeing the true colors of Democrats.
