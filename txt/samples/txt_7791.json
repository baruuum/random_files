See what happened was the person who served the food dropped them exact three fries on the floor, that lady was actually being a good Samaritan and helping the cop and taking the dirty fries away for him so he did not get sick. Long story short don't do anything nice for cops because they are assholes and will do everything they can to abuse their power and fuck over the average civilian. I made all of this up of course but all of us know never even talk to a cop unless you absolutely have to because they are just looking for a opportunity to arrest anyone because they are bored. She should have just waited for her own fries. Stupid decisions get stupid results.","post_message":"A woman was arrested in Northwest D.C. for stealing three French fries from a police officer who was dining at a U Street eatery. #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"10153271300604497","commenter_b":"Sadia","commenter_a":"Bmc Covert Joe Sanders","post_message":"\"Mom and Dad are going to be thrilled when I bring literally anyone home to meet them.\""},{"comment_id":"1234949299869862","commenter_b":"Really irritate me how she copies her speech","commenter_a":"Better to repeat the inteligent words of an inteligent woman, than stupid words of a stupid husband!
