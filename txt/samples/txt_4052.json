Mexico required voter ID which in turn gives them capabilities of voting people into office. Fast forward to illegals here from Mexico claiming that is racist to require voter ID, while their own place mandate that they have one. Is all about getting free stuff without any output. For that reason I say screw everyone of them that break the law and move here.","commenter_a":"I live in a Muslim country here is like a hell because of being Muslims.
