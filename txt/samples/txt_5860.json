Outstanding warrants for priors. (Maybe that's why she was trying to make a new start in an other state) Drugs in the car, intoxication? Then resisting. There's more here. But it all hardly seems like reason enough to commit suicide. But one never knows all the reason(s) some people take their own lives. Maybe she was facing far more serious charges or problems if returned to her home state? Maybe she was trying to flee gang affiliations. Or gang threats. None of that is even given. Just the same old blame the cops and here we go again B/S story from the press.","post_message":"This woman was arrested during a routine traffic stop.
