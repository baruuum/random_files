Every civilized nation recognizes the absolute necessity of securing their borders and maintaining the integrity of their immigration programs. It's the type of common sense that requires no apology or gratuitous reminders. Perhaps if the Mexican government wasn't so adept at destroying its own country with an endless cycle of incompetence and corruption, their own flesh and blood would not be fleeing their native homeland with nothing but the clothes on their back. And yet these are the same hypocrites who have the nerve to denounce America as greedy capitalists; that transcendent beacon of liberty, opportunity and prosperity ...","post_message":"If there's one thing I truly despise about the progressive socialist left it is their blatant hypocrisy.   One of the fall back positions for the left is always the 14th Amendment's \"equal protection\" clause. In the case of Obergfell vs Hodges (same-sex marriage) the SCOTUS ruled that marriage was an individual right and States must conduct same-sex marriages, making it the \"law of the land\" as many say.   Now, with the executive orders of President Donald Trump on illegal immigration, the liberal progressive left is again decrying the 14th Amendment's equal protection applies to anyone within the borders of the United States.   Well, based upon this, I will henceforth be carrying my concealed weapon anywhere within the borders of the United States.   Look, if all of a sudden, two men and two women have the right to be married anywhere in America, and if folks here illegally have constitutional protections, then my constitutional second amendment right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. You know...equal protection.   So, there it is, I just saved Congress a lot of work. Law abiding legal American gun owners can travel anywhere they want with their concealed carry permit. If we can't, then no same-sex marriage -- and no rights and protections for illegal aliens.
