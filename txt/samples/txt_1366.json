If you want all of the above to happen, the lost of 5 amendments to the Constitution that we all learned about in school and everything else she wants to do to put this country into the ground for her benefit only ( REMEMBER, SHE LIVES ON OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY), we have to work hard for ours, then HILLARY is your girl.

I hope she suffered.","commenter_a":"She was probley scared when all those security came at her with guns drawn thats why she tryed to move the car. Hands on steering wheel not reaching for wepon. They didnt have to shoot her.have you noticed all the killings for petty crimes like selling cigerettes, stealing a pk of cigerettes. Being homeless, even jaywalking or talking back to police. This is not a good situation. Real criminals who rape and torture getting away with it because the police would rather arrest or kill someome who is not a threat. I am ashamed of the police who do these things and the other cops who watch and do nothing and of the law that always finds brutal cops innocent. I am afraid of the police many people are. Since when should we pay for a legalized brutal mob.

Oh and why don't you ask the Haitians how much of that Clinton Foundation windfall made it to the Haitians. You liberals are absolute blind sheep. Don't you think if Trump broke any tax laws that Obozo's IRS henchman Koskinen would have taken him down already? Can't you leftist idiots run a campaign on pressing issues of the day rather than ad hominem attack and character assassination? Oh, I forgot you can't cause you fools have nothing other than soap opera drama. Hey, did ya hear Kardashian got jacked in France today?
