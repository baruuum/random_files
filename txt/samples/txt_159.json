Of course the government wants everyone against Chipotle, because it's the first popular public chain against GMO's, which makes the government food companies look bad.

The big news network had been obviously bias against one candidate and it seems that this candidate cannot do anything right for them for obvious reasons. Even the Roman Catholic hierarchy are all bent on preventing our presidential candidate to win the election. But lo and behold the people have spoken and are up in arms against these giant nerworks and rallied their candidate of choice to win decisively. Wake up America you are being manipulated by a few who have selfish interest and only have themselves to enjoy if their will be done.","post_message":"President George W. Bush was torn to shreds in 2005 by mainstream media commentators for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina â€“ yet President Obamaâ€™s detached response to the recent Louisiana floods has been met with resounding silence from those same outlets."}]
