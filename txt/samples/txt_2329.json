I really want this post to get people thinking about how we talk about these issues but also what causes these situations, not just the consequences of them. I know this is a tough situation and one that provokes lots of emotion and passion, but I hope we can talk about this in a productive and respectful way. Thanks in advance. \"Violence of any kind is wrong. But there's a serious problem when white students rioting after the annual Pumpkin Festival are described as \"rowdy\" and \"unruly\" but black protesters rioting in response to police brutality are portrayed as \"violent thugs.\"","post_message":"If you replace \"white\" with \"black,\" suddenly it doesn't sound so far-fetched.

This thing sounds real to me because I see what's happening around Russia. If American people don't do nothing to stop the US government, my country and other countries around Russia will be erased before you people even realize that the war is started. Russians have nukes, we have sticks. My country doesn't have an army, half of Russian citizens are soldiers. So while America is still thinking if the news is real or fake, we think why our governments made an alliance with USA and allowed them to build anti-rocket shields and military bases on our territory, making us look like a threat to the Russians when we are not. Here we hate wars and guns. People here don't have guns, we don't go to wars. We don't want this s***.

There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems. HRC cannot denounce Fracking. Now, before you think that article that spells out how much HRC is taking in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry is another Republican smear tactic, note that it is by Greenpeace. She has to go. ...","post_message":"\"We can open the door to every person in this country again.\" ‚ÄîPresident Bill Clinton"},{"comment_id":"1306972999355460","commenter_b":"If they come after our guns we are so screwed...This is something we better not let them do...If ever we need to fight it will be when they do come for our guns....Wake up american's...That Muslim snake in the white house is out to get us and it looks like he will stop at nothing to destroy us and our country...","commenter_a":"Yes it will!","post_message":"‚ÄúAn armed citizen is nothing for me to worry about‚Äù"},{"comment_id":"1375338609150152","commenter_b":"It's a bit of a give and take, really.
