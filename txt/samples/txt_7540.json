The middle class is paying for this by job lost and food stamps the working poor need.If this new trade agreement is good for America why is it fast tracking. America elite can build factories over seas and hire people there pay them enough to be able to buy the products they make.I believe we should start penalizing companies that move out of America for cheap labor abd export products back home. The USA will dominate no one if we do not start paying a living wage here and make jobs not loose jobs.THIS AGREEMENT BENEFITS COUNTRIES WHERE LABOR IS CHEAP THEY WILL HAVE JOB GROWTH EXPORTING TO THE USA,WE WILL BECOME A NATION OF TWO CLASSES THE ELITE AND THE POOR.","commenter_a":"There is nothing worse than a bunch of Puritans who are so sanctimonious that they would give comfort to the enemy -- people like Warren, Sanders, and Nader.

Are you serious? American citizens are being raped and murdered by illegal aliens streaming into our borders and you want them all to come on in, collect benefits paid for by American taxpayers, yet take away guns that can protect us from these illegals. You are a very disturbed person and even worse are those endorsing you and voting for you.
