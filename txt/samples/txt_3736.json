However, that's just what they want so they can finish sweeping this crime under the rug and most likely murder you while you were in jail. Count on Yashua Yahwashi to help you win this battle. I came not to bring peace but a sword.","commenter_a":"This is such a travesty. These judges are complicit in the cover-up. I remember when that girl Natalie Holloway was murdered on vacation. That case went on and on until they put that guy Ian Vandersloot (sp?) in prison. White parents rarely have the burden of proof put upon them. They should start a GoFundMe page.","post_message":"Parents of Kendrick Johnson (Teen Found Rolled Up in Mat at H.S Gym) Ordered to Pay Hefty Legal Fees"},{"comment_id":"10153638768074062","commenter_b":"And take your bimbo wife with you!","commenter_a":"Kanye, please listen to the voices in your head and leave the country!","post_message":"Kanye West opens up about rushing the stage during Beck's acceptance speech at the Grammys.

If you see the pictures and videos, there are lounge chairs and tables just feet away from the water. People can read the \"no swimming\" sign, but an alligator is not going to think twice about coming on land. I think Disney needs to close off areas where there are gators. I lived in Tampa for four years, and gators were everywhere near water. You just knew where they were, and if you didn't, there were signs. I doubt people did not know about the alligators; you can always spot them especially if there are more than three. This could have been prevented.","commenter_a":"Why were alligators allowed to be so close to where human activity is? Especially DISNEY WORLD where 1000's of children are on a daily basis??","post_message":"Officials are pulling alligators from the nearby lagoon and putting them down to check for the boy's body; so far, they haven't found him."},{"comment_id":"1115619658459044","commenter_b":"Yep.
