It is becoming more and more common in foreign countries to drug and even use ether to sedate people so they can rob them. I find the guy suspicious that said when he saw in the AM that their door was as he had left it he became worried. How did he leave it...closed like every other hotel room door? It's not like housekeeping found them. This guy called mgmt and they went in.

Mexico required voter ID which in turn gives them capabilities of voting people into office. Fast forward to illegals here from Mexico claiming that is racist to require voter ID, while their own place mandate that they have one. Is all about getting free stuff without any output. For that reason I say screw everyone of them that break the law and move here.","commenter_a":"I live in a Muslim country here is like a hell because of being Muslims.
