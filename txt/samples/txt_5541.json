Politic is a tough business. acvtually governing is something the GOP has forgotten about.","commenter_a":"What truly amazes me is that State Communications Security let her first use a personal e-mail for government business and second they let her keep an unsecured server at her home. This is a complete violation of all government communications security regulations and practices. There is no way possible that she did not send classified e-mails during her entire tenure as Secretary of State and there is no way possible that they can say that unsecured server was not hacked by outside sources. What kind of a moron would think that? The idiots that are defending this woman are absolutely CLUELESS as to the magnitude that this Security Breach is.

So many are military aged men. Why aren't they staying in their country and fighting to save it? Militant Islam is dangerous whether you agree to it or not. Letting these people into your country will diminish your country because these people will demand that you accommodate their religion and their way of life instead of them making an adjustment because they are guests. They will demand changes in established laws because they will not conform. These are not bigoted statements. These are facts that are easily verified.","commenter_a":"Why do militant atheists support the arrival of (militant?)
