Not sure but to me this seems like a modern take on that...in most cases such dancing is done for the benefit of men. But when it is done to express one's sexuality in a personal way, it does have an empowering effect. It suggests that a woman's sexuality belongs to her and doesn't need a male audience to be valid.","post_message":"I never thought a pole-dancing video could be such a tearjerker.
