These premeditated murders were likely politically motivated acts of terrorism.

I would just rather see more love in this world than hate and violence.","post_message":"North Carolina and Utah Laws Allow Clerks to Refuse Same-Sex Marriages  More than 30 magistrates in North Carolina have legally refused to perform weddings for gay couples.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"844826018983911","commenter_b":"Not even close Alex...
