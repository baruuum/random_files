They are American born and home grown terrorists that are mainly one demographic. Trump and his supporters are jokes. Trump is ALWAYS putting himself in the news. EVERY time he opens his mouth his words will be scrutinized. Trump can always dish it out but HE can't take it. Presidential candidates aren't suppose to be whiners. I hope he and the Republican party go down in flames. Most of the Republican party is spineless and/or ignorant to have the guts to publicly stand up to Trump when he's wrong. So they defend him instead. Trump is a liar and dangerous! He's the KING of denial and deflection. His goal is to divide and conquer through fear and hate. We can't let them win! WE CAN'T IGNORE the fact that the Republican platform is that ANYONE ...","post_message":"The former New York City mayor introduced Donald J.

Many women are unintentionally impregnated by a RAPIST. Involuntarily having sex is what rape is, if you didn't catch that. A women's should be able to choose if she wants to have an abortion, with advanced technology we can safely perform these procedures. Abortion is NOT A contraceptive, it is a last resort and if you wanna take the baby and provide for it along with the thousands of other rape victim babies then go ahead.","commenter_a":"Look I'm not all for abortion, nor all against it, let me just say my peace like everyone else has, and that we are all entitled to.. A females choice about her body, is exactly that, her choice. I'm not saying abortion ahould be used for a form of BC or a contraception, there are other ways, educate your children, its not just the girls in this that need it. All children need to be educated. But lets get surreal, how or what do u know about that female walking in to planned parenthood, little to nothing about her story. How do u know she didn't get raped, or isn't going thru some kind of abuse (whether it be physical or emotional) u don't know.
