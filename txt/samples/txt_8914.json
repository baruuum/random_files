As always, remember to keep sending me your questions via text to ASKBEN (@username on your mobile phone).   There were many questions from all of you asking “what is one of your favorite things about Christmas?”     Honestly, I love to see the look on everyone’s faces as they open presents – that’s the best part for me, seeing the look children have in anticipation of a gift. During this season, I always try to remind myself of the greatest gift…our savior Jesus Christ.   I know that many of us spend the week leading up to Christmas frantically rushing around buying presents, our time occupied with “how much to spend” on loved ones, rather than spending much time occupied with those loved ones. It’s about relationship, not retail. We should remind ourselves of that more often.   It is easy to become distracted by the world when we are constantly being bombarded with competing priorities, our time becomes monopolized by differing pursuits and positions, fleeting moments that will pass. Our true pursuit should be everlasting, one that cannot be wrapped in bows, it does not perish. It is peace. It is good news, in pursuit of others as we share with those we encounter. Just as we are now, you and I, sitting here together sharing this moment in time, these are the moments that do not fade or wither upon snow’s first falling – this is the season to be joyous with one another, lift others as He has lifted you, our hands united in hope.   That is why Christmas is special to me – I am reminded of the greatest of gifts every time I see my children and grandchildren’s faces. Hope.   Thank you for sharing your evening with me, I look forward to many more.   Goodnight, Ben"},{"comment_id":"10156567119170725","commenter_b":"U R A NUTJOB AND A #FRUITCAKEFORILLEGALCRUZ ! #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN #DONALDJTRUMP 2016 #ONLYAMORETRUMPNATIONCANSURVIVE!","commenter_a":"The sycophant behavior of many Trump supporters is identical to Obama Libtards, complete with vile hatred of anyone who disagrees and scummy ethics based on Utopian promises.
