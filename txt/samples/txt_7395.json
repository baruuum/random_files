To me, it just proves that the Great Orange Misogynist sees women as pawns and does not hesitate to try to use them to hurt each other. He is the textbook definition of a male chauvinist pig.","post_message":"\"If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Jennifer Flowers right alongside of him!\"  Cuban is the leading skeptic when it comes to Trump's claims about his wealth."},{"comment_id":"944373212266686","commenter_b":"Planned Parenthoods primary function is abortion.

Defunding Planned Parenthood means defunding millions of dollars in preventive care, cancer screening, contraception (which reduces abortion), STI screening, and other such essential services.
