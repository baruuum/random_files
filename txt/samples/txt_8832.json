I want my President to have clarity of thought, to speak in a measured, thoughtful and highly educated tone. I don't want her or his words to be subject to interpretation. His rhetoric is inflammatory, bigoted, and often without thought. His use of language is at best that of an arrogant, whiny, teen-ager. No way does this man possess the skill-sets needed to be my president.","post_message":"There have been multiple explanations.
