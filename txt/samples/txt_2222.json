However, one thing I do not share is the that even I am not American, not born here, you still don't get to say \"go back to China\" to me. I go where I want and I came here legally. America could be more friendly.","post_message":"An editor for The New York Times wrote an open letter to a woman who told him to \"go back to China.\" Asian-Americans responded by sharing their own racist moments using #thisis2016. Here are some of those moments.  Warning: This video includes racial slurs and vulgarities."}]
