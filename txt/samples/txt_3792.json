My Mom (bless her soul) was very inept with her money and defaulted on her student loans. Her SS WAS garnished. 15% came out every month. Luckily she lived with me so she was OK. We calculated what she owed and what was taken from her...... tax refunds and garnishes..... she paid that loan over and above YEARS before. But, they are like the IRS they charge interest for every day, week, month and SECOND you owe them money. I told my daughter, it's better to work and pay as you go and maybe take a few years longer to get an education than EVER take a loan for it.","commenter_a":"So what has Obama and the DNC been doing about this?","post_message":"How absurd!

We should be expanding social security benefits, not punishing seniors for the \"crime\" of getting a higher education. Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a crystal clear example as to why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities. In the richest country on earth, we should make life easier for seniors, not hard"},{"comment_id":"506778712863385","commenter_b":"Hillary up to her old tricks #NeverHillary","commenter_a":"It should be a mural of Obunghole screwing a goat.","post_message":"The artist included the phrase: \"Make Everything Great Again.\""},{"comment_id":"10153070562531051","commenter_b":"She needs to be put in a hospital were criminals go.
