Crime Bill vote, wasn't for gay marriage because he thought it was a 'states rights' issue. Voted to send Vermonts nuclear waste to a small latino poor town in Texas. Voted to FUND the war in Iraq and plenty of other wars. Couldn't even to get the members of the Progressive Caucus in congress, that he started, to support him. You lost. Get over it.","commenter_a":"Of course he can't give Hillary credit for winning on her own merits. It must be because of closed primaries, or \"the poor not voting,\" or whatever other excuse he can come up with. How about the fact that Bernie benefited from the caucus system in certain states that actually make it difficult for voters to participate & thereby lower turnout? I don't hear Hillary whining about that. #feelthewhine","post_message":"He's looking ahead."},{"comment_id":"693891444077370","commenter_b":"a lib angry bitch...","commenter_a":"First of all, she's just an angry bitch....second of all: who?","post_message":"Who does THIS Remind you of...."}]
