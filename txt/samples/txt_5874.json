Let's talk again when there's only days left of this nonsense.","commenter_a":"Jim Webb won this debate: he got more exposure out of the media tonight than he has had since he began his candidacy. Compared to Clinton he looks honorable, compared to Sanders he looks responsible. Since those two are the media darlings, those are the only two he needs to be compared to until he can get out of single digit polls. If any of those candidates expect to get moderate Independent and Republican voters next fall, they need Webb on the ticketâ€¦ unless Trump manages to stay in the race.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders defends his record on guns after Hillary Clinton pounces. #DemDebate"},{"comment_id":"10155622855165354","commenter_b":"Pretty soon we'll be sending them on chartered flights, like the illegal immigrants we're busy with right now.","commenter_a":"uh huh!!","post_message":"Infuriating..."},{"comment_id":"608915299267779","commenter_b":"Nigga i would murder u nigga in HIp HOp","commenter_a":"Hahaha... @username ma boy who you got?

It's about time for a woman president. There's a special place in hell. Bernie girls are just boy-crazy. It's her turn. Thou shalt not question Her Inevitability.","commenter_a":"The media have been crowning her daily since 2015. Your daily reminder that at this point in 2008, her backers (motto: \"Party Unity My Ass!\") were still promising a bloody floor fight at the convention and demanding she be awarded all the illegal Florida delegates.

He's leaving political correctness in a trail of dust.  He has violated tenets of political correctness from day one, and he is leading in the Republican polls and has pulled within six points of Hillary in a general."}]
