You see, when you dare to question one of these social justice creatures and it becomes apparent that absolutely none of their arguments hold up to scrutiny, they start with the personal attacks just like they've been taught. Thank you Tracy, for showing us all just what an utter lack of both argument and character you possess. Why don't you pop off back to Tumblr and tell all your sympathetic sisters how the nasty misogynist was harassing you.","commenter_a":"And if they end up working less hours, and being paid less as a result I'm sure we'll hear all about the sexist \"wage gap\" a little more from the social justice cretins.","post_message":"A Bristol firm allows women to work flexibly at different times of the month to tap into employees' \"natural cycle to create happier working environments.\""},{"comment_id":"10154468186761051","commenter_b":"She should never be allowed in another classroom!","commenter_a":"GOOD!","post_message":"This teacher was given the boot after video of what she did to Donald Trump went viral."},{"comment_id":"1345080275507252","commenter_b":"I cannot believe how many selfish bastard whites live in this country that they stole from Mexico with a trumped up phony war. These selfish bastards all belong to the Repubtard party. which we need to destroy.","commenter_a":"Why do we have to pay for every disgruntled citizen from every country in the world.....you politicians have us deep in debt but want more from us....All you are doing is enabling irresponsible government around the world.....everyone sees the US as the international welfare program....we have too many of our own citizens who need to be cared for....and their violence is no worse than our own....","post_message":"I hope the administration reconsiders these raids. These children and their families are fleeing extreme violence in Central America and they should have a chance to seek relief, which is why I introduced the “Fair Day in Court for Kids Act” — a bill that mandates counsel for these vulnerable individuals. Instead of separating children from their parents, the administration should continue to address the violence and instability in the region that is forcing these families to leave."},{"comment_id":"10153261123996179","commenter_b":"Siiiiiii 😍😍😍😍😍","commenter_a":"@username 😍","post_message":"Puppy bravely protects infant from very evil bad no good hair dryer."},{"comment_id":"1007311229351882","commenter_b":"@username more people die every year in DWI accidents than in 10yrs of the war..stop whinning it will be on our soil soon.thank obama for that.","commenter_a":"Good because theyve destroyed the republican party and turned it into a warmongering party filled with neocons. Trumpism will come in to replace them and become a patriotic party for the first time in 40 years. We live in exciting times and I am honored to witness it.","post_message":"\"They are as dead as emperor-worship in Japan.\""},{"comment_id":"10153951391170579","commenter_b":"We have millions of people on welfare because Illegals are doing the jobs they are qualified for...we can use guest workers legally if we need more workers...I don't see us the US needing them though","commenter_a":"The republicans are certainly changing their tune on immigration. But they have no choice. Nobody in their right mind believes that we can deport all illegal immigrants without devastating our economy and millions of families. Even Trump admitted that they could come right back, a weak attempt to lessen the blow of his ridiculous plan. Yet another win for Bernie Sanders, who has no need to flip on issues to garner support.","post_message":"Your takeaway from the 4th Republican Presidential Debate?"},{"comment_id":"10153910519885695","commenter_b":"What a pig.","commenter_a":"He should be castrated .","post_message":"Jared Fogle's attorneys asked a judge for leniency, saying he is \"profoundly sorry.\""}]
