We must make sure that you do not breed indiscriminately!","commenter_a":"Foxes are vermin and very distructive for farmers, not the cuddly toys as always portrayed by the media. However what is the most humane way to cull them.. A bullet is best but only if you are a very good shot as a wounded fox can take days to die. Poisoning is also a slow death. Trapping is just as bad as they can take days to die or try and chew off their own paws. So it looks like there is no easy answer, and no we cannot just let them breed indiscriminately without some control as you would understand if you saw the havoc they can cause especially in the lambing season.","post_message":"\"Fox hunting is a pursuit from the past and like the overwhelming majority of the population I believe that is where it should stay, consigned to history.\""},{"comment_id":"10153647321457235","commenter_b":"Hide yo wife, hide yo kids...","commenter_a":"Crazy people with guns, what could go wrong?","post_message":"They're advocating open insurrection.

Feminism should be about equality not about following one group of women's notion about what you should look, feel or talk like.","commenter_a":"I'm seeing a lot of diversity in the Muslim community about the concept of World Hijab Day (non-Muslim women wearing the hijab for a day in solidarity).
