He got bad coverage in the NYTimes and research on the conservative voting base.  I just thought it was a typical trump circus non sequitur.  I hadn't seen this story until now.  I feel sorry for him.   It just isn't going to end well for him.  Maybe I am wrong but I just don't think the American conservative likes the bully act.  Is everyone who disagrees with him:  fat, ugly, stupid, loser or failing?  It is amazing to see anyone not in the Obama White House with an \"enemies list\" this large.  Be fore he ran for president he was always a nice hotelier to me and my family.     I said four weeks ago that I did not want him on the show as the only thing to be gained was fifteen minutes of ratings and seeing that my ratings have never been higher nor have my commercial rates been higher, I didn't feel it was worth the trade of integrity.  He is welcome on many talk radio shows.  Not mine.  I will stick with Cruz, Carson, Fiorina, Santorium, Paul and tomorrow Bobby Jindal.  My audience rates Donald Trump consistently in tenth place in the race.   We have spend the last 16 years learning about progressives.  My audience is not fooled.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1170571449649992","commenter_b":"A lot of dumb chicks out there..","commenter_a":"Love it!!!","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"895578827165435","commenter_b":"nothing ever happens to her for her lies!!!!","commenter_a":"Keep digging, @username.","post_message":"As the Speaker notesâ€” Having finally heard from Secretary Clinton yesterday, we are left with more questions than answers. These public records at issue are broader than Libya and broader than Benghazi. The Secretary of State has enormous responsibility and jurisdiction and the public, the media and Congress have a legal right to access these public records without impediment."}]
