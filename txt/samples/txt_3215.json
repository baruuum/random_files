Who would pay for that. Our taxes would have to go way up to cover that. I don't think Don can cover that out of his own pocket.","commenter_a":"I am an American. My children are American. My Grandparents and Great Grandparents were immigrants to this country. They came from Poland, Germany and Italy. I am a woman. I am successful in the male dominated auto industry. Donald Trump has spoken against every good thing I have been taught to be proud of in America. He is a ignorant, lying buffoon. #imwithher","post_message":"Yesterday, Donald J. Trump said that the judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University should be disqualified from his job because, in Trump's words, he has “Mexican heritage.”   Judge Curiel was born in Indiana—and last I checked, that's in the United States of America. Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. He’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.   Let's be clear about what Trump is saying. He thinks that because Judge Curiel's family has Mexican roots, he can’t do his job. Donald Trump isn't just wrong about this; his words show that he’s wrong about America. He’s wrong about what makes this country great. And on a day that we are mourning Muhammad Ali, let's remember that we live in a country where people can break down barriers, worship their own god, choose their own name, and lead and follow their dreams as far as their hard work and talent will take them. I’ve always believed that in America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is—we should be judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, heritage, or religion. Well, it's time to judge Donald Trump by his words and deeds. And I believe that his prejudiced, bigoted words and deeds disqualify him from being President of the United States."},{"comment_id":"1873334889566400","commenter_b":"I'm thinking entertainment value.
