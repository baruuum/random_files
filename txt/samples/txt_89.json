Many women are unintentionally impregnated by a RAPIST. Involuntarily having sex is what rape is, if you didn't catch that. A women's should be able to choose if she wants to have an abortion, with advanced technology we can safely perform these procedures. Abortion is NOT A contraceptive, it is a last resort and if you wanna take the baby and provide for it along with the thousands of other rape victim babies then go ahead.","commenter_a":"Look I'm not all for abortion, nor all against it, let me just say my peace like everyone else has, and that we are all entitled to.. A females choice about her body, is exactly that, her choice. I'm not saying abortion ahould be used for a form of BC or a contraception, there are other ways, educate your children, its not just the girls in this that need it. All children need to be educated.
