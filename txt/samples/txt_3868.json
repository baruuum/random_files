That should have been the cue for an almighty dust-up. Yet, one by one, a billionaire environmentalist, a former mayor of Los Angeles, and the lieutenant-governor, have all stepped aside so there is only one serious candidate. Are they scared? Yes. And they have every reason to be: Ms Harris is an intimidating opponent. The daughter of an Indian cancer researcher and a Jamaican economics professor, she is the first woman, first African-American and first Asian attorney-general of California @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"905141892877096","commenter_b":"You are a gruberized voter.","commenter_a":"Based on the polling from this thread Roy should keep his money and not bother to get re-elected. @webpagelink","post_message":"Missouri was one of the first states in the nation to reject President Obama’s fundamentally flawed health care law. For the past five years, I’ve heard from countless Missouri workers, seniors, and families who are facing higher costs and fewer choices due to the president’s health care take-over. As we mark the 5th anniversary of #ObamaCare becoming law today, I’m still fighting to repeal this flawed law and replace it with common-sense health care solutions."},{"comment_id":"10153868198207994","commenter_b":"There is a need to protest because even though this vile cop has been charged, he hasn't been convicted. We know how sympathetic jurors are to police. Hell most of the people commenting here would probably find him not guilty. This is more than just one bad cop.
