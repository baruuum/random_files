Since when does a \"leftist\" spread anti-Obama propaganda and refer to fetal tissue as \"baby body parts\" as you and your ilk do?

No, use a cover please.

But, he is right, when the children are hot and fussy, they are no longer enjoying the event. They are miserable and they are making the person next to them miserable and you too. That's not fair to your child or the patron sitting next to you. I know parents want to see the rest of the game but, that's one of the sacrifices we make for our young children. Changing a soiled diaper in such close proximity is rude and plain nasty!","post_message":"The Cincinnati Reds are opening a nursing suite at their stadium for nursing moms who want to feed their little ones during the game.
