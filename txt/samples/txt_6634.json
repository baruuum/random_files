In short, White people are starved for heroes, but Black people have chosen villains for their heroes, and feed their souls on poison. And what people of any age can rise above their heroes?","post_message":"Four out of 10 African-Americans said they doubt the nation will ever achieve racial equality, but as many white Americans believe racial equality has been achieved, according to a national study released by the Pew Research Center (From PBS NewsHour)"},{"comment_id":"531806736985283","commenter_b":"No deal why is this bitch still free lock her up","commenter_a":"He can't, Hillary, not without the approval of the People!","post_message":"“The Europeans, the Russians, the Chinese, they’re going to say, ‘we stuck with the Americans, we agreed with the Americans, we hammered out this agreement, I guess their president can’t make foreign policy.’”"},{"comment_id":"1890349187852006","commenter_b":"One does not have to TRY to cast america in a bad light..... The racists & Nazis here do a good enough job by themselves. America is NOT great, & will never be great again until the cancer which arrived here In 1492 is removed.

All 3 of these women have helped over the years to set Americans back 30-40 years. They are simply useless Politicians!! I agree with @username, Diane Fierstein and everyone who voted in favor of her proposed bill should be thrown out of office for violating their Oath of Office. This Bill had it passed would have been in violation of the 2nd and 5th Ammendments, and to attempt to pass such a law is clearly a failure to \"protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Enough of this Liberal Politically Correct BS. Time for change and Hillary and Bernie clearly are not the answer.","commenter_a":"Time to vote the senile out of office or just plain remove them!! How do you prove innocence if you haven't done anything? So they could just accuse you of something and then make you prove you \"didn't\" do it?????? And in the meantime you couldn't get a gun!! Is she for real??","post_message":"You won't believe that Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein just said about due process.
