I like Trumps idea on closing our borders for a time being and this is why and a simple example. Please come to my house I have a bowl of 10,000 M&M's and in that bowl I may have 100 but at least 2 M&M's that are poisoned and will kill you the moment you put them in your mouth and slowly corrupting the bowl. So I want you to stick your hand in the bowl and eat a handful! Oh you won't? Why not oh cause the odds are your gonna die? Oh I see but it's ok to let 10,000 immigrants in knowing some are most likely deadly. But won't eat 20 M&M's because at least 2 out the 10 grand will kill you what's the difference??","commenter_a":"The immigration and Nationality Act passed June 27, 1952, revised the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, and nationality for the United States. That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today.

This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.
