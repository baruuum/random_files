Deport them all!","post_message":"On the Texas immigration ruling: President Obama is well within his established Constitutional authority and the legal process will bear that out. The only effect of this ruling is to delay justice for thousands of families in Nevada and across the country. Governors, mayors and law enforcement officers have emphasized that these programs are good public policy, help our economy and keep our communities safe.  Courts are only involved in the first place because Republicans have spent years blocking Congress from fixing our broken immigration system. Congress should live up to its responsibility and pass an immigration bill that secures our borders, keeps families together and provides an earned path to citizenship.  There is nothing stopping the Senate from debating immigration legislation immediately. Unfortunately, the Senate is mired in a completely avoidable impasse over funding the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats have a simple solution for getting out of this jam: take up and pass a clean bill to fund Homeland Security, then move on to a robust debate on immigration legislation.  Democrats’ offer to first fund Homeland Security and then debate immigration stands. All Republicans have to do is say yes."},{"comment_id":"10152853525740667","commenter_b":"If she needs to step down than Bruce Jenner needs to be a man","commenter_a":" Michelle","post_message":"Last week, Rachel Dolezal's parents said she was born Caucasian and has been deceiving people into thinking she was African American."},{"comment_id":"10157246765295294","commenter_b":"Deport this piece of crap!","commenter_a":"He can be charge with a misdemeanor for starting a fire with out a permit","post_message":"An expression of free speech?
