You are still avoiding what you are going to do with the illegals that aren't criminals. Actually they did break the law if they came here illegally and if they stay here even if they don't get citizenship it's still ammnesty. You need to be up front with what you are going to do.","commenter_a":"Great speech!!!!","post_message":"Thank you for your wonderful support last night- with regard to my Immigration Speech that I delivered at the Phoenix Convention Center.

This is because they want to change America's FIRM laws to fit their Anti American agenda! Obama and the Anti American socialist judges do not have the right to make law! Thats how Obama's illegal Obama care was approved! I fear that our once free country is in grave jeopardy of being overrun by these evil Marxist!

Did you know that if Obama care is rebuild and replaced if you have a pre-existing condition then you cannot get medical coverage just like before during the Bush administration","commenter_a":"Truth! Dirty Donnie is playing us like a fiddle! All about him so he can make $$$$! He is not FOR anything but himself! Do you really think he is for you blue collar workers or the struggling middle class? Once he gets what he wants, he'll throw you to the gutter like a piece of trash. He is all about the $$ going into his pocket. His \"plan\" would put the workers back into the industrial age. Company town and company store, no unions, no rights, keep your mouth shut and just maybe you won't get fired, thrown out of your home, and dumped on the street! Tax cuts for the rich and everyone else can pay for it.
