Oh I see but it's ok to let 10,000 immigrants in knowing some are most likely deadly. But won't eat 20 M&M's because at least 2 out the 10 grand will kill you what's the difference??","commenter_a":"The immigration and Nationality Act passed June 27, 1952, revised the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, and nationality for the United States. That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in chapter 2 Section 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by , violence or other unconstitutional means. This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.

She cares nothing for the populance as a whole and her smug haughty stance of needing a public and a private stance politically make me sick. Tack on her criminal past, and right wing agenda, and you bet your ass no progressive should consider voting for that pandering shill. Im done voting for a lesser evil, and will stay vigilant in ensuring a third party gets political funding, and grassroots activism because our system and the Dempublicans are controlled by a criminal elite and they are the enemy of Liberty, Justice and Freedom! #JillStein2016 #GreenNewDeal","commenter_a":"Down","post_message":"This Just In –"}]
