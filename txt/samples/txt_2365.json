The only reason they gave back access is because a court battle over this would have revealed to the public that every democratic campaign had access to those records, and when the Sanders campaign reported it, nothing was done. Which would have highlighted not only the DNC favoritism of Clinton, but of the fact that they have been working to shut down Bernie at every turn. Which would have meant public acknowledgement of Bernie actually having a chance to win.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders sued, and the Democratic National Committee backed off, but it's not over yet."},{"comment_id":"1697499920518952","commenter_b":"Um that's the point!

There is no way you should be neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. But you're playing weak. Go on the attack. Use your willingness to stay in a marriage regardless of your husband's infidelity as a selling point. We all know people make mistakes. Marriages often dissolve over a hint of unfaithfulness and unforgiveness. Only the extremely strong can take a mistake made by a spouse to demonstrate their character. If I'm not mistaken this is Sanders' second wife and 'The Donald' has had three wives and several affairs. How many times have you been married? They can't use President Bill Clinton's infidelity to their advantage, but you can. Who are the people advising you?","post_message":"Jimmy Fallon: Can we do a Snapchat?   Hillary: Sure! ðŸ‘»"}]
