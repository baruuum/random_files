And Trump has had multiple scandals of his own, including email scandals. It's also a known fact that every politician in history has had some sort of scandal in the course of their career.","commenter_a":"And according to James comey if you do what Hillary Clinton did you would be reprimanded, probably fired and have your clearance pulled if not have criminal charges like in the military, but you can still run for president.

Bernie's current top priority at the convention (as stated in a conference call with his delegates) is to change the Democratic party rules to \"un-rig\" future Democratic primaries so they will be fair to future Democratic party presidential candidates. For him (and our delegates) to have any chance of making future Democratic primaries more fair via votes in the rules committee at the convention, we need to get all our pledged Bernie delegates funded. We are still at risk of losing over 100 pledged Bernie delegate votes, purely due to lack of funds. That's down from over 200 a couple of weeks ago because we have never stopped trying to get them funded.
