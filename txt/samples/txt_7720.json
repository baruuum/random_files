I have never met the families that need their child taken. All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first. When you take children from their homes, good or bad homes, put them in counseling. Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."},{"comment_id":"10153809354827169","commenter_b":"Let's make a new list and start it with Tamir Rice.","commenter_a":"White people in America don't have Race Hustlers disguised as Christian Reverends telling the young men that they can't win in life because they're a victim, nor have Whites exalted bards who glorify violence against sex objects that once were loved as women, violence to police, and street crime.
