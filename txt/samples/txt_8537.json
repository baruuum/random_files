The timing for Baldwin’s hat couldn’t be better, coming as the president-elect sat down with security officials on Friday who told him the Russians helped him win the election — an assertion Trump flatly denies because it would contribute to the belief that his win is suspect having lost by over 3 million in the popular vote."},{"comment_id":"10153584406778352","commenter_b":"stupid girls!!!","commenter_a":"They need to be committed for a long long time","post_message":"Two Teenage Girls Kidnapped a 14 Year Old, Made Her Masturbate, and Tortured Her For 17 Hours By Scalping Her Hair and Pouring Salt Down Her Throat"},{"comment_id":"10153249874686051","commenter_b":"Girl...

Poverty, desperation, lack of global perspective, dread and hopelessness all dim the people's hope. Terrible place to live. For an uplifting story about this neighborhood check out HONY's series on Ms Lopez and her school there. So much work to be done, sadly the people who live there are the most marginalized people in NYC. Short of starting over, not sure what will happen to the poor in that city in the way it's going. These are the extreme sides of the coin of gentrification.","post_message":"The woman, 18, was walking with her father when 5 men approached them."},{"comment_id":"10154131960333797","commenter_b":"It's a free country.
