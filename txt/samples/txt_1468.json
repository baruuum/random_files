Yesterday a Texas court struck down the US Chamber of Commerce’s attempt to overturn a new Labor Department rule requiring retirement advisers to put their customers’ interests first. The decision affirms what we already knew: this conflict of interest rule was lawfully enacted and the rulemaking process took the views, costs, and benefits of all the stakeholders into account. Now President Trump needs to follow suit. He should stand up to the Chamber of Commerce — and the armies of lawyers and lobbyists that brought this frivolous lawsuit — and allow the rule to be implemented in April as planned.  Hardworking Americans saving for their retirement deserve to have a retirement adviser who is recommending the investments that are the best for their retirement security, not the ones that let advisers pocket kickbacks and prizes."},{"comment_id":"10154979828776729","commenter_b":"Is a mean evil witch all she wants to do is kill us Americans in line her Pockets with more money how can she even be running for president?
