These wingnut lefty/leberial woman who are marching all over today are really attempting to fight over their treasured planned parenthood. They want to keep the free goverment \"healthcare\" for women. Correct me if I'm wrong but, isn't their local welfare office giving out medical cards to cover 100% of their \"healthcare\" needs??
