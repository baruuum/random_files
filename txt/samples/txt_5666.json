Basically, all it is is reducing the amount of acid you put into your body from drinking soda, etc. They even make stuff you add to your water to alkalize it. Things like soda, obviously, and even milk although it is alkali in the container, once ingested it turns acidic and wreacks havoc on your body. Lemons, albeit acidic on the outside actually turn alkaline once ingested. You can actually look up guides to acidic and alkaline type foods. If you go to a Walgreens, health store, or wherever and pick up a roll of test strips in the health aisle, you go home, pee in a cup/container, dip the test strip in and look on the chart to see how much acid is in your body, then you take the steps necessary ...","commenter_a":"Want the cure? Eat right and use alkaline test strips until you test as alkaline as possible. Cancer feeds off the acid in the body, the more acidic you are, the better chance of the cancer spreading. If you are alkalized, cancer has nothing to feed on.","post_message":"A young woman has become the first person in the world to give birth to a healthy baby using ovarian tissue that was removed and frozen when she was still a child."},{"comment_id":"10153356804576336","commenter_b":"The words that come to mind wouldnt be appropriate for FB or for a lady to say....smh.","commenter_a":"Obuttma is a hug a thug..what is wrong with his brain⁉⁉","post_message":"The number of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention center is now 116, compared to 242 when President Barack Obama took office."},{"comment_id":"10155015963219199","commenter_b":"Always use condoms jeez you never know who has it.","commenter_a":"This senseless act could have been avoided if we would have banned all Mustangs after the first Mustang ran into a crowd.","post_message":"Surveillance video shows a man on a bicycle in the Phoenix area being run down by a Ford Mustang."},{"comment_id":"10152797088006051","commenter_b":"Burn em all down.

The major reason was that 70% of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction under six years of the Obama administration. The WSJ Editorial Democrats vs. the Middle Class shows the devastating impact of Obama and Democratic Party progressive policies over the last five years on the middle and lower income class. Progressive Policies buy votes, but destroy prosperity. Anybody with incomes less than $70,000 has been devastated with losses of around 6% to 8% while inflation lowers buying power. @webpagelink","commenter_a":" 12-Step Program for Recovering Democrats is a WSJ Editorial to help Democrats make a recovery from the shock of the last election.
