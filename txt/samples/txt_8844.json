And in case you have forgotten all the other bodies this witch has left in her wake......Just a quick refresher course we forget what has happened to many of the Clintons. 1- James McDougal Clintons convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr investigation. 2 Mary Mahoney A former White House intern was murdered July 1997 at a Starbucks Coffee Shop in Georgetown ..

Instigators to anti-police sentiment? Comments like Paul's are simply deniers to the findings of two separate independent investigations that produced identical findings. That is, Brown never had his hands up, was never surrendering and he was the aggressor.","post_message":"The Justice Department has finally confirmed what many of us were certain was the case: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told the truth about what happened when he said he shot Michael Brown in self-defense. After a six-month investigation, the DOJ concluded that Brown, allegedly a thug and a thief, was not trying to peacefully surrender when the incident occurred. He did not hold his hands up and say, “Don’t shoot.” And he was not shot in the back, as some alleged. @webpagelink"}]
