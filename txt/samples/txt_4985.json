They should just remove the robes and wear clown outfits.","commenter_a":"Franklin Graham The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled today that same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states. With all due respect to the court, it did not define marriage, and therefore is not entitled to re-define it. Long before our government came into existence, marriage was created by the One who created man and womanAlmighty Godand His decisions are not subject to review or revision by any manmade court. God is clear about the definition of marriage in His Holy Word: a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24). I pray God will spare America from His judgment, though, by our actions as a nation, we give Him less and less reason to do so.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10153939704691178","commenter_b":"With this huge influx of illegals and radicals the REAL AMERICANS are in danger of extinction , wise up Hollywood!","commenter_a":"Must have fallen fron his star ship and landed on his head.","post_message":"Kind of hypocritical coming from a guy who owns tons of planes."},{"comment_id":"10153000609386491","commenter_b":"The Russian lady nailed it. For me, I don't want kids and that is unacceptable to so many people. She only wanted one and that was JUST AS UNACCEPTABLE! We know what we want our families to look like. Trust us, we're women!","commenter_a":"I respect your decision to not have kids. Some people don't. It's an important job that should only be done by people who want you. BUT, I think making a decision like that at 28 years old was a little rash. A lot of things change. I had my daughter when I was 39 years old. Things that make you happy in your 20's are not necessarily going to be the same for the rest of your life. And, don't be sad for people who tell you that there is no greater love than one for a child. There isn't!! Don't knock it just because you don't understand.","post_message":"‚ÄúWhat I want is to be happy.‚Äù"},{"comment_id":"10155005314954062","commenter_b":"@username Gale Adams @username @username Christina Marie üëÄüòíüòî","commenter_a":"Justin Irwin","post_message":"Please be careful to all of our friends in the Conroe area.

We need less politics. Clinton's and Bush's destroy this country. Carson is an actual person, not a career politician.
