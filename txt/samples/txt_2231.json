How can something that provides the best source of nutrients for a baby be considered too obscene to be observed in public where as men's which are just another body part be considered fine?! Free the nipple doesn't require a woman to bear all. I won't be, I've had no reason either functionally or otherwise to display mine in public (it's a bit cold in this part of the world) but my body is not obscene. I totally support the women doing this. If nipples are so provocative it's the sexualisation that society places on women not the female nipple owners that are the problem.","post_message":"\"It has to be said that, to the casual observer, the #FreeTheNipple campaign is a very confusing thing. Let‚Äôs just get this straight, one might say, it‚Äôs a feminist movement that encourages toplessness, and which has led to an Icelandic MP, respected as a serious parliamentarian, getting her boobs out for everyone to see.

Because as an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, Sanders, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the \"Trump Strong\" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Strong Again!
