Women may become dependent on prescription painkillers more quickly than men. Women may be more likely than men to engage in “doctor shopping” (obtaining prescriptions from multiple prescribers). Abuse of prescription painkillers by pregnant women can put an infant at risk. Cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)—which is a group of problems that can occur in newborns exposed to prescription painkillers or other drugs while in the womb—grew by almost 300% in the US between 2000 and 2009. ---@webpagelink","commenter_a":"These addictions for many were not choices but had a slow way of happening. Many were prescribed pain relieving drugs after surgery or have a bad back or another painful injury and the doctors wrote prescriptions for opioid medicine like the were going out of style. The family that owes the company that make Oxy, are literally billionaires now just by selling Oxycontin. When you write millions of prescriptions for Oxy in less than 20 years, what the hell do you think that will happen? Many of those people become addicts if you take these drugs for a long enough time. When the doctors stop writing scrips, the people turn to any source available. IMO, Doctors are responsible for the current heroin epidemic in this state and country.","post_message":"“It focuses on a social service intervention as opposed to criminal justice intervention, and it’s been very successful in Seattle,” Portland Mayor Michael Brennan, who is a licensed clinical social worker, said."},{"comment_id":"578813518988176","commenter_b":"He needs to be voted OUT","commenter_a":"Give them his job !
