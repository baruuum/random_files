Yes, I get triggered, but it's not neuroscience to accommodate folks.","commenter_a":"Ovid yes and no. EVERY single one of the stories includes silencing of one kind or another-- often violent, often sexual violence. But it is a political poem by an exiled poet who was being silenced. HE tells a story about a bad (silencing) king and then says something directly to the emperor-- \" And you oh Augustus...\" Zeus was a rapist but he does not get praise for his philandering; his wife punishes the victim (the mother of nearly every demigod) since her husband is in power, but some god or goddess usually intervenes. Those rapes or dalliances are metaphorical for deeper political angst in Rome.","post_message":"Some professors believe trigger warnings build trust. Others think they stifle free discourse."}]
