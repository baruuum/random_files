Over the years your passion and knowledge have helped me evolve my own perspectives on politics and the news. However, I respectfully disagree with your use of pejorative terms to describe women in this fashion. I think it is as much demeaning to you, and women at large, as it is to the targets of your invective. I respect your assertion of your right to use these terms, and you have articulated to me in the past why you choose to use them. I respectfully disagree with it.","commenter_a":"Those Fox News bitches really whore it up with the make up, don't they?","post_message":"\"You canâ€™t separate fiscal issues from social issues...\""}]
