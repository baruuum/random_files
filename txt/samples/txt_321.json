It dates back to at best sometime in the late 70s/early 80s. I remember a girl in my youth group had brought one of her Mormon friends one summer's eve, and I got into a conversation with her and I'll remember what she said til the day I die- \"I'm not a Christian, I'm a Mormon!\" That would have been 74 or 75. Also, the concept that \"As God was, so man is; as God is so man may become\" is utterly missing from the other thee Abrahamic faiths.","commenter_a":"Um, no. The miracle IS the resurrection.

Sad that she hunts for weak married men because clearly she can't find one of her own! See picture !","commenter_a":"Correction - the person going out of their way to cheat is to blame for not trying to fix any problems their relationship may have, for not giving their partner a chance and lying. Women like her who go with men knowing they're are married give the rest of us a bad name, she should be ashamed of herself, coming out with drivel like that just proves she has no morals and is kind of desperate for any male attention, but she is not completely to blame here either. Fix what's wrong in your relationship and if it's unfixable then leave, DON'T CHEAT.","post_message":"Woman who has had 100 affairs with married men blames their wives"},{"comment_id":"10153600253057431","commenter_b":"Well stated @username. Irony received. ðŸ˜‰","commenter_a":"White supremacist exist whether as paramilitary, or the idiotic Trump supporter who thinks he owns everything and everybody telling a Hispanic American (Jorge Ramos) to go back where he came from, to people who will destroy other cultures way of life for a dollar because they have no respect for others. They are so pervasive the only way to resist them is for people of color to band together. To pretend white supremacist don't exist or that they will magically disappear is to ensure their continued control over our lives. Working together to overcome an evil is not anti-American, it's just common sense.","post_message":"Fighting White Supremacists: Don't Forget, We Are In It Together!  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"970311343085644","commenter_b":"Sick perverted inbred barbarians!!","commenter_a":"He'd get a face full of beer then we take it from there.","post_message":"We were drinking at local brewery in Dripping Springs last Sunday.
