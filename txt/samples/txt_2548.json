Unfortunately we all probably knew this was the case even before reading the story. I'll be shouted down by Pit defenders as is their norm, but I don't care. No other breed is killing other dogs and humans like this, and this breed needs a re-set NOW.","post_message":"A French bulldog puppy that died after being attacked by another dog while in the care of a Petco-owned dog-boarding facility has prompted calls for #justiceforboggs.  The Pooch Hotel Hollywood representatives initially told the dog's owner that Boggs was taken to a vet as a precaution after an altercation, according to the owner's roommate. About 45 minutes later, an ER vet called to say the puppy was in critical condition with a torn trachea and multiple internal injuries.   Described as \"13 pounds of pure joy,\" Boggs was put down as her out-of-town owner listened helplessly on the phone. Now she is considering legal action.

Trump on the People reporter who said he sexually assaulted her: \"Take a look. You take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.” He is grotesque.
