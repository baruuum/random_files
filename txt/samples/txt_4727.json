Giseleangelique D, 47, of Thousand Oaks allegedly sought out young mothers under the guise of a charitable organization looking for women with 1 to 2-month-old infants to assist.  That's how D found Eliza Delacruz, police say. She allegedly stalked the infant's mother and then had a co-conspirator snatch the child. Three other people were also arrested in the alleged plot, which includes an attack on another mother and child in El Segundo.   What investigators say they can't figure out is why 3-week-old Eliza was killed.

Boston bombing. ect. and how is it that an illegal can have a job, without knowing the English language. no American education?? the come here, and still believe that the American dream is still alivem but we Americans are the ones that destroyed it.","commenter_a":"THAT'S the way!
