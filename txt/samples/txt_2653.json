The one question I can't seem to get an answer to is this,,, WHY??? Why are both sides attacking Trump? Why is China attacking Trump, Why is the pope attacking Trump? Why is Mexico attacking Trump? Why are the Republicans going against their own pledge and attacking their own front runner? Why is HilLIARy so afraid of Trump? Why does Trump have this Republican Party split? Why is Mitt Romney going after Trump? Why are the Koch brothers dumping in 75 million dollars to go against Trump?

Leviticus 19:33-34 ESV ‚ÄúWhen a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Before anyone starts screaming Old Testiment. Mark 12:30-31 (NIV) 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô[a] 31 The second is this: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô[b] There is no commandment greater than these.‚Äù","post_message":"Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said his country  not pay for any wall, defying the claims U.S. President Donald Trump has made."}]
