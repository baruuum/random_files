However we are definitely called to judge actions. In the case of same-sex marriage to support same-sex marraige is to supoort something that goes against the Bible's definition of marraige. Same-sex marraige is social, cultural, and traditional. Social, cultural and traditional acceptance will change with time but Biblical truth does not. Therefore I believe that we are to love everyone but support what is right in the eyes of the Lord.","post_message":"Brenda Wood 11Alive looks back at the fast-moving and historic events of last week in Monday's Last Word -- \"Same-sex marriage: Judgement Day.\"  More Last Words: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"732442150279696","commenter_b":"close our borders and weed out this cancer trash","commenter_a":"Get registered to vote the right way.
