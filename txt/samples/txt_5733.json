Even Muslims know Islam is not a religion but an ideology of submission only. Therefore you owe Ben Carson an apology for being correct when he said they are not covered under OUR constitution. READ the Quran for yourself Carly and you will find out that you are an Infidel and are to be killed if you do not SUBMIT to Allah. Does that sound like someone our constitution would support? I think NOT!","post_message":"Carly Fiorina just revealed what she thinks about Ben Carson's comments about a Muslim serving as President of the United States - and you might be surprised with where she stands...  Do you think Fiorina is showing her true colors?"},{"comment_id":"1334326533266897","commenter_b":"For the first time in American history a foreign hoe for first lady","commenter_a":"I wouldn't be Melania - even for a billion dollars!! I lived with a narcissist. She has my pity! I'm sure she is paid well to stay with him, and her frozen Botox face and designer wardrobe says it all.","post_message":"Politics aside, Melania Trump's modeled some winning looks on the campaign trail."},{"comment_id":"10153398381514364","commenter_b":"Social security is the world's biggest pyramid scheme.
