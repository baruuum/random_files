Churches don't pay taxes! Planned Parenthood is doing a service that they are legally allowed to preform because there are women choosing to have those services done. Christians have no right do insist this be stopped just because of their religious beliefs. I'm sick of Christianity being all high and mighty thinking that it is the end all be all of decision making for everyone else on the planet. Not everyone is a Christian and not everyone must be. Defund your churches!! Make the churches pay taxes!! Every time a Christian stops an abortion make a Christian take in an illegal alien and put him/her through school/college!! Stop hiding behind your bible and pretending to actually care about the embryos because we all know when you're not cursing abortion your wishing gays would go away and praying extra hard that your children won't turn out to be ...","commenter_a":"You know what's really ironic? Your religious organization doesn't pay taxes yet you're complaining about the money spent on abortions. Another thing is that you want to stop abortions but there's starving children right there in your neighborhood and your church and its congregation all have food on their tables, cars, cell phones etc. Then, you even complain about paying for birth control because it goes against your religious beliefs but then you expect non Christian tax payers to pay for your churches. In addition, you believe that your Christianity should trump my rights as a woman and you should decide what I should do with my body because of what your bible says. Well, I'm telling you NO!! Abortion is legal and its going to stay that way because of people like you. Women like me will always be here to stand up for our rights not only just ...","post_message":"Planned Parenthood has made a business out of destroying that which God has created. The one-sided relationship between it's ever-growing bank account and American taxpayers must be severed. That is why I introduced the \"Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.\"   #ProLife #DefundPP"}]
