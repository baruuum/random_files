And since you have to take medicine for the rest of your life so your body won't reject your transplants use your pee brain which you obviously have and think about the medicine that's affecting your skin color and NOT the fact that an African American gave you his/her parts to keep your sorry butt alive.","post_message":"This man says that receiving a transplant from an African-American has turned his skin black.
