People should take a look at Ted Cruzs resume and determine who is the presidential one. It is the most Impressive I hAve ever seen. He is a man of integrity with a brilliant mind. No skeletons in his closet. He is a true conservative who lives by the constitution. That is why he battles in Washington because he lives by what is correct. Look at all the cases he has won. He doesn't fit the mold of Harry Reid and company. He bucks them all the time. America needs him now and if we let him Slip by it will be our loss. There is absolutely no one running that can fill his shoes plus he is a born again Christian and he will restore our religious beliefs back to the country and constitutional rights","post_message":"Bill O'Reilly met with candidates right after last night's debate, and there was one thing Trump said to him that immediately caught people's attention...
