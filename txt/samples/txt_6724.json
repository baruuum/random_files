If the USA PATRIOT Act secured your family, then Hillary is your candidate. If your family reaps the benefits of institutionalized racism in our justice system, then Hillary is your candidate. If you want more expensive healthcare, vote Hillary. Mine is currently $475/month (compared to my $25/month car insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month dental insurance, but I digress). Hillary is in bed with big pharma, she is your candidate. If you want to vote democrat, but still want to bomb Iran, then Hillary is your candidate. If you really benefitted from the Housing crisis or from Monsanto bankrupting small farmers or Big Pharma price gouging the sick, then @username is your candidate","post_message":"“It’s not just that she’s done her homework—Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name.”"},{"comment_id":"1012141178845630","commenter_b":"She owes no one a child.

She treated the father horribly. TLC destroyed this family. Just as you have one mother young ladies; you also have one father. He nurtured you as well when you were babies up to the point your mother ran him off. Look at your old pictures and first episodes of your show. Your father was pretty much left with nothing.","post_message":"“He doesn’t even know us”"},{"comment_id":"10153510448341130","commenter_b":"Because they turn away NO ONE. Because it cost a lot of money to give out free care. Or low income women can pay a small portion vs. going to a CLINIC where they want your soul before you get care. Many women are struggling to EAT.
