This influx of illegal immigration is causing emergency shelters, areas typically designated for use during catastrophes, to overflow, leaving local government scratching their heads as to what to do with immigrants who have no place to go and can‚Äôt be deported back to their home country.... Border Patrol agent Hector Garcia accused the Obama administration of ‚Äúaiding, abetting and facilitating the smuggling of illegal aliens across the border.‚Äù In an interview with CNN, Garza said the current influx of illegal immigrants is ‚Äúorganized‚Äù and ‚Äúorchestrated‚Äù by the drug cartels.

Yes deport those with criminal record, but why throw out hard working folks like my parents who come here for a better life and contribute to this country. They also pay their taxes. People screaming out CRIMINALS to immigrants as if US citizens weren't criminals. Instead of complaining about immigration, perhaps you should demand the government to stop exploiting other countries' resources and their people.
