Women are the worst....if you want to wear a form fitting dress...go for it.....if not....that is good for you. Please stop.","commenter_a":"I don't understand where the problem is.

That is a reflection of voters failing to elect officials who actually do their job. Our government was originally structured in order to make congress the most powerful branch. Unfortunately, modern Americans think the president holds all of the power and are far too ignorant of what their congressmen are doing. Despite an approval rating below 40%, reelection rates within congress are still at 96%. That is your problem, not the president. Granted, Obama doesn't really help matters, but even as a republican I must concede that it isn't ALL his fault, and quite honestly regardless of the fact that he is a poor president there are no grounds for impeachment.","commenter_a":"Why don't you impeach this man.

Oh Oh someone is actually deciding that the Manchurian fraud president could actually be an Islamic terrorist. Well the grasshoppers may actually be waking up to that fact. What the hell do you think I have been saying for the last six years. In the movie the Manchurian candidate American prisoners were being brain washed by the Chinese to undermine America and it's politicians and kill them. In Obummer's case he was indoctrinated into the Muslim cult and communism by his father mother and his in-law's. There are no Muslim or Islamic American's because they will give their lives for Islam. They are instructed by the Koran to deceive the infidel's and make them think that you are their friend. When the time is with us we will torcher them and then kill them in the name of Islam There are no good Muslim's . That is for outward ...","commenter_a":"Yes","post_message":"Millions of Americans have suspected for quite some time about Barack Obama's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.
