She doesn't even pay equal to men in her own foundation and campaign. Bernie's \"socialist destination\" is s fulfillment of FDR's vision. Hillary will fulfill the Koch brothers and Walton family's vision. I don't revere poverty, nor do I support buying an election and using electoral fraud to gain office. No, Bernie won't \"part the Red Sea,\" but the electorate he is inspiring will effect a revolution.","commenter_a":"It seems to me that the Super Bernie people are caught up in useless passion over issues that are neither new or original. I distinctly recall when Mrs. Clinton went to capital hill and pitched for universal healthcare on live television. She was eaten alive, but she stood her ground as she has on the grassroots level many many times. She's always been there for women especially where wages were concerned. And there is so much more. Mr. Sanders is not a bad person but it is a bit disinginuous to ride the democratic train to get to a socialistic destination. It's also unfair to insist that anyone who has made the system work for them is a bad person. Bernie is no more deserving of reverence for the money he doesn't have than Hillary for the money she does have. She worked for hers' and he worked for his. ...","post_message":"Time to unify the party."},{"comment_id":"1240263705993657","commenter_b":"@username Oh Dave, ad hominem?","commenter_a":"NBC's biased information.

Lest you forget she helped cover-up atrocities committed to the Irish people in the occupied 6 counties. Allowed 10 hunger strikers to die and was forced out of office.

What a disgusting mindset to see an entire sect of humanity as subhuman. For the record, men can vanish off the face of the earth tomorrow and humanity will still survive.","commenter_a":"What a sad sight to watch, so many people fighting for the right to kill there own children. Children are the children of the Father. Man can make babies with artificial overs, in a tube, but women can not have babies without a man's sperm, woman are only carrers, all children come from there father first. Maybe instead of worrying about having aborstions, we worry about the decay in society which cases the need for them in the first place. We must raise our standards.","post_message":" intent is to try to put the fathers in the process. My bill would stop the abortion if the father does not agree to the abortion."}]
