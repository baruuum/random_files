It is also obvious that there will be another attack here in America and Washington is doing nothing to stop it. Their solution is to take our guns away from us so we have no means of protection what so ever. America wake up! We must get rid of Obama before he gets us all killed, it is just that simple!!!","post_message":"We know ISIS wants to infiltrate our homeland, yet our borders remain unsecured.

To fellow pro 2a people, don't play into their hands like this. Look. Let's pretend you were right. That the good guy with a gun scenario doesn't really deter anything. fine. Let's pretend you are right. That having guns so that people can defend themselves against tyranny isn't going to do anything. Fine. Let's pretend that we can depend on our government officials to protect us against foreign invaders 100 percent of the time without fail. Fine. Let's also pretend that you get all the gun control laws you want passed. Done. Now let's pretend that so far a vast majority of the recent shootings weren't perpetrated by individuals who up until the shooting had little to no signs of deteriorating mental health and zero criminal history. Let's also pretend that those same individuals did not purchase their firearms LEGALLY ...","commenter_a":"Liberal code. NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!!!

It's just what they do; and it's the reason they should never be allowed to hold any position of power. To hate for no good reason is insane. Obviously none of the people here who hate Trump have no idea WHY they hate him except maybe that they were manipulated to do so. You don't have to like him; you're not hiring someone to be your friend (although that might be the only way you can get friends); you're hiring a POTUS so vote with honest logic. Not feelings.","commenter_a":"There's no denying the fact that he's more wealthy than even the elitists in Washington can hope to be; AND it's obvious that if you're that wealthy; the IRS has already seen your taxes so there's nothing hidden about his returns except just like yours; they're not PUBLIC knowledge. The only ones who want to make a big deal about them are the people who are scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to find something they can twist into a questionable issue that the most ignorant of voter will be swayed with.","post_message":"“There’s nothing to learn from them,” said Donald J.
