If you have to murder physicians who perform a legal medical procedure, heavily edit videos to try to discredit an organization that is doing nothing illegal and burn down their clinics, then who is really the violent killers and terrorists here? All in the name of Christianity? Not my Christianity certainly. Reminds me of the middle east, however. Islamic terrorists/Christian terrorists. There is no difference when you cross the line into violence.","commenter_a":"Damm","post_message":"\"It's deeply disappointing that we still see the kind of hateful rhetoric in our state that fuels this kind of violence.\""},{"comment_id":"10153628379818145","commenter_b":"Feed your own kid. Simple fix. And teach the little demon to sit still and learn.","commenter_a":"My son is 6, and gets recess twice a week!!!! Twice!!! He then gets in trouble because, as most 6 year old boys, he gets out of his seat and wiggles all day. But the kicker is what he's fed! Sugar sugar sugar for school breakfast! He's even come home and told me he had a freaking pop tart! What the crap! Then he's punished for their stupidity. Schools need to lay off the sugar, and allow for atleast 20 minutes for recess. I vote for 20 mins twice a day. My son would be SO much better for his teacher! (Oh, and I agree with many comments....get rid of this common core crap! It's just that....CRAP!!!)","post_message":"Do you think that Florida elementary schools should be required to provide 20 minutes of recess every day?"}]
