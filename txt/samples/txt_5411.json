Leviticus 19:33-34 ESV ‚ÄúWhen a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Before anyone starts screaming Old Testiment. Mark 12:30-31 (NIV) 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô[a] 31 The second is this: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô[b] There is no commandment greater than these.‚Äù","post_message":"Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said his country  not pay for any wall, defying the claims U.S. President Donald Trump has made."},{"comment_id":"10157272858800389","commenter_b":"This is very inappropriate. It is not the job of Ginsburg to comment on any of the political constituents, democrat or republican. Her job is to interpret the law only and she is way out of bounds in this matter.
