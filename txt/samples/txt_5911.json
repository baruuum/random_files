What about Christian imperials from England who colonized, enslaved, stole and murdered people during their colonialism , don't they have Christian knowledge, 2. What about Christian Europeans colonizing America and stealing their land, murdering millions of natives, 3. What about white Christians enslaving blacks people in America treating them like animals and killing blacks for sport.

And of course they do numbers most ppl think the radio is all there Is to offer. And I'd say 3 ouuta 4 drake fans r girls. Drake can go hard but he chooses not to cuz that don't sell albums to women...so instead he's like \"long as my bitches love me\" lol","commenter_a":"It's funny how people who don't like hip-hop or don't like Drake's music post derogatory comments .If you don't like it don't post it,I think music like Young Thug(or when Gucci Mane was hot) & HALF of what I hear on the radio is trash lyrically but perfect for a party,but I don't sound off on it b/c the numbers that these songs/mixtapes/albums do,speak for themselves regardless of what we as neigh-sayers,b/c it's not our cup of tea,may say about it.Although I am biased to Drake's music,I love music period so why don't we all just take a lil advice from a19 year old(myself) & actually be grown about what we post instead of being ignorant cause honestly,8 times out of 10,nothing we say is taken into major consideration by the famous.In the words of Kevin Durant,\"Why do you tweet?\" lol...dang","post_message":"Is it an album?
