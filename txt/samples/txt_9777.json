I don't know a lot of women who regretted NOT aborting their baby. I know quite a few women who DID regret aborting their baby. And I know a lot of judgmental, intolerant women who pronounce when they think another woman SHOULD have had an abortion. That, and Margaret Sanger's avid stance on eugenics, says a lot to me about who is pushing the abortion agenda and who is falling for their bs.","commenter_a":"I was assaulted & I chose to keep my baby. For me I only had 2 choices either A. Keep her or B. Put her up for adoption. Killing my baby which is abortion never crossed my mind. Today she is almost 9 months and I thank God for her every day.. She is a blessing to me and God has a plan for us. I can't imagine my life without her. If your Pro-life you believe in LIFE No matter what.. So even in assault/rape or incest a baby should live. It's not the baby's fault what happened. No one knows how a baby was conceived.. God has a plan for ALL unborn babies.","post_message":"Christie and Bush attack Cruz, Rubio for being too pro-life"}]
