I'm finding your people somewhat heartless and they sound from my perspective to be violent and racist themselves... No different in fact than the terrorists that have become their perpetrators. This is what fear does to people.. Aggressive behaviour .. We are so much more than this. I felt so sad when I read the response to Obamas humanitarian speech. So sad that you people have such fear and hatred inside you. This attitude of hatred and intolerance against people you don't even know personally will never make a better world. It just perpetuates the same old story. I feel Sad. Very very sad today.","post_message":"\"Many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves â€“ that's what they're fleeing.

I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats.
