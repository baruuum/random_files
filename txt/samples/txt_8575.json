And I'm a gun owner and a supporter of the Second Amendment. But I couldn't give you more credit that we need to deal with the wrong people getting guns, especially with mental illness. As you know, in Tucson we had a person who had all kinds of trouble and was able to buy a gun. In Virginia Tech. In Louisiana‚Ä¶ So from a gun owner, from a reddest of red states, and a person who owns guns, more power to you.‚Äù ‚Äîan attendee at Hillary‚Äôs town hall on gun violence prevention in Manchester, NH"},{"comment_id":"10152869358831336","commenter_b":"We should get rid of the Kkk.

Having someone plow into your home is not only traumatic at the time of the event, but then there are all of the repairs to deal with. It can take months to get it all put back together. And insurance doesn't cover all of the costs. Guess who gets to pick that up. Not the kid. She wasn't over reacting. If anything, she was quite conservative. I would have gladly beat the stuffing out of the one that hit us.","commenter_a":"I'm probably the only one who is think Kim... Is.. Well... Being a little actress like in all these tweets.
