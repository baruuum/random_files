We don't take care of people who are mentally ill. Rather (thanks to Reagan who closed the public hospitals) we either put them on the street, or we bake them first in prison, and *then* put them on the street. Europe takes care of both of these problems much better than we do. That said, the statistics are clear, countries that have more guns, have more gun-related deaths and injuries. Guns within easy reach are far more likely to do harm than good.","commenter_a":"Today another mass shooting of children by a mad man which took place at almost the same time Republican mad men held unethical hearings about the falsehoods that Planned Parenthood are killing children for profit. If the Republicans wanted to investigate a terrorist organization that is solely responsible for the verifiable mass death and carnage of America's children, and other innocent lives, they'd be investigating the National Rifle Association and its members. It's time we realize the NRA and Republican cohorts are terrorist organizations and the Democrats are as guilty and cowardly to do anything to reign in this insanity, as they too are as beholden to NRA dollars as the Republicans. If these were Muslims murdering our children at this rate instead of deranged Caucasian white men, who make up the majority of the Republican voters, all of the Mosques would've been leveled and Muslims would have been rounded ...","post_message":"Another day in America."}]
