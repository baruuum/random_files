Shut your mout bloody pig","commenter_a":"BBC News's journalist didn't have any story to write about Britain's own daughters? Those 1400 plus little girls who were repeatedly raped at the hands of Muslim grooming gangs for over a decade? Why couldn't she manage to that in her own filthy backyard which even produces terrorists who are raping and killing women in Syria & Iraq? Why did she feel that it was her duty to make a celebrity out of a rapist? Besides, the swines who are crying here for her are the same swines who objected to capital punishment for the rapist; who are now making money publishing stories of Nirbhaya. The pimps in Indian media who are talking about this are the same swines who objected to death penalty for the rapists. @webpagelink","post_message":"\"It was not rape, but my reaction was too involuntary, and its intensity too high, to say that nothing bad happened.
