In the adult world, you must present logic, facts and empirical evidence, which I did. Which enables me to say \"I win, you lose.\" It's ludicrous to even debate about how badly CA has done over the past 20 years due to liberal socialist policies. They're more in debt than most third world countries. Jobs and people are fleeing the state and illegal immigrants are destroying CA. I'd no more debate this than 2 +2 = 5. In summary, you're not only a loser but a leftist idiot. Ciao stronzo.","commenter_a":"America is the same.
