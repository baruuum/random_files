Too late. Two wars have been fought on our soil and much blood shed to protect our American way of life and that includes the right to run a busniess free of foreign rules... do not continue trying to bring foreign laws into the equation..it doesnt fit!!!. America's laws are the way we live life..NOT islam..thats for syria etc..those rules are SOOO not ever going to work here so just try to relax and accept it. Get some counseling.

He has given no indication whatsoever that this is the case. As a matter of fact, he does just the opposite. Do you seriously believe that building a wall at the Mexican border and not accepting any refugees will do anything to stop terrorism? The roots of terrorism are not illegal immigrants or refugees.

Educating people...by talking about Islam, by visiting a mosque, by saying he will stand with the Muslim Americans. That doesn't mean he hates Christians or ...","commenter_a":"Congratulations Mr. TRUMP. We look forward to seeing you here in SC.
