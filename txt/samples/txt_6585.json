Maybe you can sensationalize more Halloween hoarder homes while you're at it. I am glad Nickcole Dykema didn't actually hurt any Deputies (and she most likely could have, ambushing them in her own home like that), and glad the Deputies didn't kill her. This is a lesson for Police dealing w/ the mentally ill everywhere. I do hope this woman gets access to proper mental healthcare, and that through treatment she can find her way back into the world with peace and dignity.","post_message":"Multiple deputies received injuries at the \"house of horrors\"   From removing weapons from the \"booby trapped\" home"},{"comment_id":"10154733856841509","commenter_b":"Hillary is a farce ridding on husbands shirt tails belongs in the kitchen not in the White House.

He's kicking protestors out of the rally and saying \"All lives matter\" well then why are you kicking them? Trump's supporters are uneducated and racist as he is. Trump shames America's name.

Also if you think this is the best country in the world you must be ignoring the debt, constant war, and division of society by ethnicity, race, sex, religion etc. that is plaguing this country. So if you think this country is not oppressive then you are wrong. If you think this country represents equality you are wrong. If you think this country represents democracy you are wrong. If you think this country represents the bourgeoisie elite and capitalist greed then you are right and that is why I won't support the flag not to disrespect the troops who died but to respect them because they died only for greed and American imperialism.","post_message":"Allen West Republic"}]
