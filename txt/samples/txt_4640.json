PROVIDED, that they become members of the country they decide to make home. Non of this lets make Sharia law zones like back home bollocks. How do you separate the good from bad?

You are responsible for those by knowingly understanding some of the bad is coming with those who need your countries protection.","commenter_a":"The assumption that these guys are all refugees is really telling. *Open your eyes a bit, these fuckers are homegrown.
