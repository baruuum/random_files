And now Republicans are wanting to defund Planned Parenthood despite the fact that abortions make up only 3% of what PP does. SMH... @webpagelink","post_message":"In recent weeks, the American people have learned more about the barbaric practices Planned Parenthood uses to take innocent human life. Despite the outrage of millions of Americans, Planned Parenthood’s response has been to blame the messenger or the videographer, without addressing the barbaric practice of harvesting aborted body parts.  We need to let Planned Parenthood know that the American people do not support these inhumane practices. Congress should vote to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood before we leave for August recess. I urge Senate leadership to give every Senator the opportunity to affirm that life is a sacred and precious gift that must be protected."},{"comment_id":"10153113695899330","commenter_b":"Lmao Megan, whores are cool.
