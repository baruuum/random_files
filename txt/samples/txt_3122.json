Why don't you educate your fellow man instead of scaring them and filling their tiny little minds with this ignorance; there are so many untruths in this article, number one being the use of the term \"body parts\". Since the majority of abortions are performed at the 12 week mark, these are embryos with no body parts to speak of. There are no videos that show any of this yet that is the main point of your argument. Second, fetal tissue is donated to medical research which is legal and most republicans voted it in (look up fetal tissue for medical research law) and had been, most recently, used very successfully in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Hundreds of thousands of women were getting abortions BEFORE Roe V Wade legalized them. You are more likely to die due to childbirth/pregnancy complications than an abortion. 3. You are contributing to your own problem. Teens that had received comprehensive sex ed were 60% LESS LIKELY to get pregnant. The states with abstinence only education have HIGHER rates of teen pregnancy compared to states that actually teach sex ed. Why do women get abortions? Unwanted pregnancy. Much less likely to get pregnant when you're using contraception. It's not rocket science. 4. Abortion isn't free. The Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal funding of abortions except in the case of incest, rape, or danger to the life of the mother.
