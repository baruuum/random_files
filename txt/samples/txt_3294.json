Even our simplest tools at one point put someone out of work, probably starting with the wheel. If you want to walk away from technology (or just some technology) that's your choice, just don't try and force others to pay for your choice.","commenter_a":"Low skill workers have been making this argument for generations since the first automation came about and it still doesn't work. Someone still has to design, manufacture, install and service the machine. Someone has to stock supplies for it to use. Still plenty of jobs, just not the job you were doing yesterday. They are also overlooking the other basic problem that the Government doesn't create wealth. If you get a freebie from Uncle Sam, that came out of someone else's hard earned money via taxes. If we're all sitting at home due to this miracle automation, then there's nobody around to pay the taxes to fund the government. It simply doesn't work. Worse, we've seen countless times around the world how it doesn't work and people still don't get it.","post_message":"Simply put, the idea is that Uncle Sam will cut citizens a regular paycheck whether they work or not."},{"comment_id":"896147533775276","commenter_b":"We Americans are beat. Face it effort to assist citizens verses supposed immigrants (illegal) is futile. We are sold out! The few elite own the few corporations and all are subjects of the foreign owned NON \"federal\" reserve! GOVT benefits were advertised south of the border. The border is not secure. Enforcing US deportation laws are ordered on STANDING DOWN. An increasing invasion of illegal foreigners flock into our nation. So now, the govt is offering huge tax rebates to illegals never having paid taxes! I give up!
