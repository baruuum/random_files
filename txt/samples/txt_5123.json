Fun to watch these morons head explode!!","commenter_a":"Although I'd love to see a woman president, the very last thing we need is a career criminal like Hillary Clinton (who's currently in violation of Article VI of the Constitution) . She's proven herself time and again to be both incompetent and dishonest. She has no new ideas, and will continue to push Obama's tired old routine of increasing taxes, not for the domestic good, but so that we can send billions to Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt and Israel. I would like a President who puts America first, for a change. The only candidate I've seen who shares these sentiments is Rand Paul, and he deserves my vote. By the way, many people are unaware that Obama's Democratic administration added $1.3 trillion in new taxes to small businesses, which lowers both wages and job creation. If you love America, vote Republican.","post_message":"Opinion: When Ayatollah Khamenei speaks, it pays to listen."},{"comment_id":"10154115958779740","commenter_b":"How is chatting about baseball anything like questioning someone about their personal relationship with religion...?","commenter_a":"If they can't talk about repentance and God then they can't talk about anything else either outside of the law and professionally defined parameters consistent with law enforcement .
