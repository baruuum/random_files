That is a reflection of voters failing to elect officials who actually do their job. Our government was originally structured in order to make congress the most powerful branch. Unfortunately, modern Americans think the president holds all of the power and are far too ignorant of what their congressmen are doing. Despite an approval rating below 40%, reelection rates within congress are still at 96%. That is your problem, not the president. Granted, Obama doesn't really help matters, but even as a republican I must concede that it isn't ALL his fault, and quite honestly regardless of the fact that he is a poor president there are no grounds for impeachment.","commenter_a":"Why don't you impeach this man.
