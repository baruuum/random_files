Yes, we need to have strict immigration laws but due to our decades of non-existence of it due to the fact that we can profit from it, people shouldn't be punished and exceptions to the rule would exist. There are undocumented people who have been here all their lives, kids who know no other home than here and good tax paying people. Criminals - yes get them out. Instead of a wall use technology and more man power at the border. Create temporary work visa give. By employer, families who are working and are not a burden to the system can stay. There are better ways.","commenter_a":"\"let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men happiness.
