Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was \"stronger together, peace, love, equality\"......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters.

He is the President elect. He won because People are tired of the false unemployment rate Obama is pushing. Tired of the rising cost of Insurance except for people like you who probably get it for free. Tired of the war with radical Islam that he has no strategy for winning. Tired of illegal aliens pushed on us and tired of sanctuary cities and tired of people like Kate Steinle being murdered by them. You certainly can't blame Trump for any of those things. Have a nice day in your la-la land world.","commenter_a":"Actually, Barack Obama is responsible for Trumps win because he has screwed this country so badly and people are sick of his shit and knew that Killary is not only unqualified, dishonest as hell, and a total liar but that she would continue Obamas agenda to destroy our country.","post_message":"Barack Obama said that Russia is responsible for Donald J.
