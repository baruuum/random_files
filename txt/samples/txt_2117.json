Can women still vote? $$ facebook doesn't want you to see this $$ As long as America's richest 1%, who now possess 70% of the wealth and don't bother to vote, have the Senators in their pockets the United States Government isn't representing the will of the people, it's the 1% that's running the show. I stand with Bernie Sanders, \"We're governed by an Oligarchy.\" The number of Americans living in poverty will continue to grow while the middle class will continue to shrink and working women will continue to enrich the wealthiest 1% for the next 20 years easily!

Politics isn't about the best possible person: it's about the least worst. Hillary Clinton is the least worst by a country mile. We know where she stands. We know how she thinks. We know how she works. We know she's a fierce supporter of women's rights. We know she's learnt a lot of painful lessons from her time as first lady, Senator for NY, and as Secretary of State.
