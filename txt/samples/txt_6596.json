That will make it easier for them to set up quick and easy direct deposit accounts to collect their paychecks from Putin.","post_message":"By casting the hack as a \"national security issue,\" Giuliani said, Clinton's campaign and Democrats have \"proved ... she's a liar.\""},{"comment_id":"10153196939420047","commenter_b":"Remove yourself from The United States of America. You Don'T America's Ways. LEAVE!!!","commenter_a":"It probably should be removed. Does a nation that promotes the murder of the unborn and celebrates a counterfeit\"marriage\" trust in the one, true God who has revealed Himself in Scripture? Nope. Meaningless words that don't impress the God of all creation at all. Repent and believe the Gospel.","post_message":"Avowed atheist Michael Newdow is at it again.  He's just filed a federal lawsuit demanding that \"In God We Trust\" be removed from U.S. currency.
