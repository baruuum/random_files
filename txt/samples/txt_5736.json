Americans shooting animals for fun! why are people shocked by this? Also these are HUNTERS not POACHERS, poachers take things from the body for monetary gain, hunters just kill either to cull or for pleasure. All hunting should be banned!

If you have to murder physicians who perform a legal medical procedure, heavily edit videos to try to discredit an organization that is doing nothing illegal and burn down their clinics, then who is really the violent killers and terrorists here? All in the name of Christianity? Not my Christianity certainly. Reminds me of the middle east, however. Islamic terrorists/Christian terrorists.
