You have never been part of a winning national campaign your whole political career, and with Donald \" The Crook\" Trump it looks like your record will be kept intact. Your only hope is that everyone has missed this army of Donald \" The Crook \" Trump supporters out there that just can't wait to vote from Donald \" The Crook \" Trump. But the only factual data that we have right now is early voting numbers,and so far Hillary Clinton is leading in the battle ground states including Florida,if Donald \" The Crook \" Trump looses Florida it is ball game over, he will never reach the 270 electoral votes to win the election. He has to win Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, and turn a blue state or two red.

Asked by the MSNBC host whether a bakery whose owners have religious objections to the ruling should be compelled by the government to bake gay wedding cakes, Baldwin insisted that religious free speech has no place outside churches, synagogues or mosques.  @webpagelink"}]
