Nice try there. It's pretty goddam pathetic that the absolute BEST the \"party of values\" could scrape up is a con artist who cheated on wife #1 with wife #2, has FIVE children from three different wives, wife #3 lied about having a degree and may possibly be an illegal immigrant; Trump appeared on the cover of Playboy and owned strip clubs AND gambling casinos; admits he wants to bang his own daughter; mocked the handicapped; supports torture; numerous business failures; bribed Florida AG Pam Bondi; is facing ethics lawsuit regarding Trump University, and that's just off the top of my head - yeah, right. Some \"Presidential\" material. So shove your fake-ass BULLSHIT stories about emails and Benghazi, you cheap phony \"patriots\" supporting Trump.","post_message":"Election swing: Donald Trump is now leading Hillary Clinton by two points in a major nationwide poll.

George W Bush came along and reaped havoc on every financial sector, leaving millions losing their homes, Savings depleted and left America in the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Barack Obama won the Presidency and without any help from obstructionist Republicans, Obama saved America from another Depression and stabilized America's financial sectors. We need to Support and Vote Hillary Clinton for President of the United States to continue President Obama's Legacy and Policies, building on his successes and making America even greater than what it is. Republicans have been and continues to be America's Greatest Enemy!

That chicken, beef, bacon, etc. are almost from animals living in poor conditions and slaughtered. It's just favoritism to defend one animal and not another. To condemn one country and not another.
