If she was driving drunk then she committed a crime. Having someone plow into your home is not only traumatic at the time of the event, but then there are all of the repairs to deal with. It can take months to get it all put back together. And insurance doesn't cover all of the costs. Guess who gets to pick that up. Not the kid. She wasn't over reacting. If anything, she was quite conservative. I would have gladly beat the stuffing out of the one that hit us.","commenter_a":"I'm probably the only one who is think Kim... Is.. Well...

Ridiculous.","post_message":"\"This young girl could have killed herself, her friends, and me. Frightening.\""}]
