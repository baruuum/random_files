It's just that, apparently, people can get the \"disease\" of the addiction under control if they see government is serious. **** The Nation of Islam cleaned up some housing projects in the 90s, again, with lots of negative reinforcement--then the ACLU and bleeding hearts put a stop to that. **** If such measures here could stop drug-related deaths and murders, and give people in projects safe places to live, we would have a net gain. Kindness to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.","commenter_a":"Oh, well then . . .
