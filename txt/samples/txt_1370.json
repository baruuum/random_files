After Bummercare, we were told that 40 million Americans were still uninsured. One year later, we were told that 55 million Americans were either uninsured for under insured. Islamic religion prohibits insurance because they claim it's gambling and are exempt from getting insurance. With the current influx of refugees and people sneaking into our country and getting free medical, welfare and food stamps, how many millions are now in this country unisured or under insured? Why would anyone bother to get insurance? Hospitals still take patients, doctors still see patients, and medicine is still sold at the pharmacies. If no one has insurance, costs will immediately be adjusted and negotiated at a lower cost. People will stop running to a doctor for every sniffle.","commenter_a":"amazed it lasted as long as it did, now the states are left holding the bag right along with those folks who tried to abide by that totally damaging obummercareless law.","post_message":"Oh Not Again! 400,000 Americans Enrolled In Obamacare Need To Find A New Plan"},{"comment_id":"10153486509166320","commenter_b":"Stupid woman.

Oh same difference, WSJ/FOX. I got confused there for minute her hair is yellow instead of blond. I guess that's why Murdoch doesn't have her on FOX, put some peroxide on that hair and Murdoch will make you a star!

Think about it: End abortions, brings on many children that the parents can't care for (likely because of finances). The child likely grows up in poverty, being told (by the same people that ended abortions) he/she is a leech on society (parents likely getting assistance), so that child will grow up and most likely do one of two things (a few will take a different path, of course). 1) begin a criminal career 2) join the military to be fodder Republicans want to abort YOUR children when they are adults....THAT is why they want to end the termination of unwanted pregnancies.","commenter_a":"Attack on women!!!!! All you saying baby killers start adopting them then...start helping poor young women survive during pregnancy and after child is born, start fighting for wic, head start, etc...how many severely disabled children have you adopted?

What about MY rights as an average Joe peeing in \"comfort\" like I have my entire life . Yes, peeing next to a drag queen is disturbing - no difference in my mind .","commenter_a":"For all you folks who think people just wake up and decide to become a different gender just to be a pervert - think about this: why would anyone want to put themselves through all of that ...hormones, family dynamics, ridicule from idiots, discrimination? Just for fun? Because they are some sort of sexual deviant? For all of you who say women should be women and men should be men because that's what God created...he created us all as individuals with our own thoughts and feelings - and yes, he even created those who feel trapped in the wrong body. Respect people for who they are, not where they came from, or who they become. Discrimination disgusts me.","post_message":"Yep, this pretty much says it all."},{"comment_id":"10156113293015725","commenter_b":"all you haters can eat a bag of liberal dicks!","commenter_a":"That's okay - Presidents don't have time to run Celebrity Apprentice!
