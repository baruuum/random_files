We need to stand up and love one another despite differences! Isis has definitely scared a lot of people. It would be nice if the Muslim community would make a statement in response to the killings around the world. Just to declare they are different of the terrorist and that what Isis has done is wrong. Then I think there would be a better understanding of Muslims. But even still there will remain evil people , like this man at Kroger. I'm constantly praying for our world. The world needs love. The world needs God. Blacks against whites. Whites against Arabs. Muslim against christian.

And if the animal was not scared by the screaming, perhaps a tranquilizer shot could have been used... Perhaps we need to have some strict guidelines for us humans visiting zoos,","post_message":"If a tranquilizer dart, which takes five minutes to 10 minutes to work, had riled Harambe, the child might have been killed.
