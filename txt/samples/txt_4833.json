Preach.","commenter_a":"If you actually listen to what he's saying he explains everything and the reasoning why he was doing what he was doing. Maybe not the barrel roll but everything else is explained. The reason why he told those kids to get down was because they ran and were evading the police. I didn't see how that went down but he at least it to them and did not physically harm those kids. He used physical aggression on the girl yes, but multiple times he told them to leave...they didn't so he made an explain by trying to arrest the loud mouth that couldn't shut up and walk away. She resisted arrest and he forcefully tried placing her on the ground multiple times, where she continued to resist arrest and then for some reason it seems like the in thing to do today for young teenagers and college aged students but ...","post_message":"Here's why Officer Eric Casebolt's barrel roll is worthy of your attention..."},{"comment_id":"10154343672430329","commenter_b":"Well said @username.

Hickenlooper is putting Colorado communities at risk as well as the Federal Government! 26 States as of today have refused to take any. Less States mean more refugees per State. Obama wants upwards of 200,000 refugees! If we would have wiped them out early, the world would not be in this position! How many refugees would we receive in your State if only 10, 5 or 2 States allow them? They will migrate to other states and most will go on welfare, food stamps and Obama care, not to mention the cost to educate them or the real cost of American lives from terrorist attacks in our communities! What price do you put on that Mr Speaker!? Hickenlooper as well as the Federal is putting our communities at a security risk ...","post_message":"Our nation has always been welcoming, but we canâ€™t let terrorists take advantage of our compassion.
