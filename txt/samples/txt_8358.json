The number ending up at Calais is miniscule, the article also states most don't even know about our benefit system so maybe we left behind a massive impression after colonising half the world they figure we are the country they admire or can relate to, to be honest i don't care, if its they live or die then they should live here","commenter_a":"Those people in calais are not true refugees or asylum seekers, if they where, they would claim fir asylum in france. EU law says that they should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Last time I checked, france is a safe country, so is spain, italy, germany, and many other eu countries. What I don't understand is why there are over 5,000 of these so called asylum seekers camping in calais trying to get into the uk. If you are a genuine asylum seeker, you don't get to pick and choose where you want to live.","post_message":"When you’re facing the world’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, it helps to have a sober debate about how to respond. But to do that, you need facts and data – two things that the British migration debate has lacked this summer.
