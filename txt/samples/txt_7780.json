There is no way you should be neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. But you're playing weak. Go on the attack. Use your willingness to stay in a marriage regardless of your husband's infidelity as a selling point. We all know people make mistakes. Marriages often dissolve over a hint of unfaithfulness and unforgiveness. Only the extremely strong can take a mistake made by a spouse to demonstrate their character. If I'm not mistaken this is Sanders' second wife and 'The Donald' has had three wives and several affairs. How many times have you been married? They can't use President Bill Clinton's infidelity to their advantage, but you can. Who are the people advising you?","post_message":"Jimmy Fallon: Can we do a Snapchat?

The Ukraine government was propped up by the Russian government at the time Manafort was dealing with them. It was Russian/Soviet Union weaponry that took the life of a cousin in Vietnam. I'm a veteran from the Reagan era and broke out in a cold sweat every time general quarters was sounded thinking Russia/Soviet Union had finally attacked us. From the day I first opened my eyes Russia/Soviet Union was my country's enemy. Today's Russian government mirrors the government of my former enemy and the GOP candidate praises their leadership and hints that we should crawl in bed with them...I THINK NOT!!!!!","commenter_a":"Well, this is not news; Dumbocrats support rigged elections not the popular support.
