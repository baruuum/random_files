More Virginians now die from these overdoses than car accidents, and law enforcement currently lacks the tools to save more lives. I’m pleased the just passed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) will encourage co-prescribing of naloxone – a life-saving drug – alongside opioid prescriptions and also implements a measure to protect the elderly from medication abuse. I worked with a bipartisan group of colleagues to draft and introduce these provisions. Lastly, while I am pleased Congress was able to work in a bipartisan way to address this crisis, we should keep working to provide emergency funding that is critically needed for state substance abuse programs, law enforcement, treatment and other priorities authorized in this bill."},{"comment_id":"10156573724785294","commenter_b":"This sickens me!
