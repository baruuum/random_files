The Hill reports that  for gun control [an increasingly fringe group in their own right] have high hopes for Hillary Clinton presidential run, seeing her as  ally who can finish the push for tightened background checks that has stalled in President Barack Obama second term.  Indeed, Clinton has been a vocal gun control supporter for more than 20 years."},{"comment_id":"10153974959029087","commenter_b":"@username I would be suprised if you cared.","commenter_a":"Funny to read some of the Trump supporters defenses that show they didn't read the article. First, the pictures weren't taken outside of the US, they were taken here. So the argument that they \"could have been taken outside of the country\" doesn't hold weight. Second, yes, models come here and do photoshoots \"all the time\", however, as the article states, there is a way to do it legally, and a way to do it illegally/fraudulently. From her own statements, it seems there might be a case where it was done wrong. And lastly, it does matter because Trump's platform is \"do it the right way, she did it the right way\", and if she didn't do it the right way, then it is yet another lie and makes them hypocrites. I realize she isn't running, but he is so he made this an issue. If this were the Michelle ...","post_message":"Melania Trump has said she first came to the United States in 1996 on a short-term visa, which wouldn't have allowed her to work as a model. But a recently published nude photo shoot shows that she was working in the country in 1995."},{"comment_id":"10153290749172426","commenter_b":"Had he handled it the nasty note wouldn't have been left.

See picture here at @webpagelink Only thing that makes sense was that she was being fed the answers. That's why she sounded so scripted and robotic. Donald Trump was Presidential tonight. Hillary's \"in you face\" lies to the Veteran who asked the question about National Security cannot inspire confidence in the American public. How can anyone still support her? Trump is the only choice! America First is the plan!","post_message":"THANK YOU to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great! In addition, THANK YOU for hosting us this evening, Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum! -DJT"}]
