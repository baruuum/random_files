I'm so concerned that with Ms. Clinton's ability to \"Fix\" things she may have the ability to fix the election. I'm a true believer that this also happened in the current Pressident's second election. I am afraid that the Dem party will be in place for many years to come with the young and uninformed youth being targeted supporters through free things offered to them as well as dead people and illegals voting. . I'm hoping I am very wrong though. God help us.","commenter_a":"Wow!! While speaking on fox news live right now Mr trump actually seems presidential. This is the tone and demeanor we, the people have been asking you for. Let hillary bury herself. She will!!!! Be a better man. Be the man America needs. We want to believe that you can lead us but not unless you can start to act and sound like a good president.","post_message":"Radical Islamic terrorism threatens our world.

I wonder since when he was sendings them money. that's why noooo I don't miss Obama ! I don't agree on some stuff Trump is doing but I hope he can makes this country great cause Obama did a lot of F***** up stuff to this country and I guess that's what people want a president that lies to us and do stuff that we don't know !!!","commenter_a":"What?

What gives you the right to choose for anyone? What's next? Fat people can't wear bathing suits? Pretty girls have to wear short skirts? No one... NO ONE has the right to decide what someone wears. Change laws to promote freedom. Let them choose. Don't choose for them. Clothing doesn't oppress any more than guns shoot people. People oppress. Change that.","commenter_a":"It oppresses women. Before everyone says it's s their religion, it was taught to them by a man. And yes all religions use other ways to oppress women that should stop as well. I always find it odd that people champion the right form them to \"choose \" what oppression the want to follow.","post_message":"A new country is debating banning burqas."},{"comment_id":"10155104320669614","commenter_b":"Liliana Sanchez ghetto AF.","commenter_a":"Losers","post_message":"Officers recovered a large amount of stolen mail, checks, W-2's, government identification cards, and narcotics after arresting the pair, authorities say.
