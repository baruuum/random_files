Israelis should decide what future do they want for their children, one in which they are perpetually fighting a war, or one in which they can make peace and learn to live with mutual respect. --- As far as ethnic cleansing is concerned..this is again the same issue. It is only ethnic cleansing when the Jews are forced out of their homes, it is not ethnic cleansing when ZIonist militants throw out Palestinians from the homes they were living in for centuries.","commenter_a":"The way I see it Israelis will be in the Palestinian villages for a long time..... society whose leaders campaign for a convicted terrorist to be given the Nobel Peace Prize, a society that teaches its children hatred and violence as part of its standard curriculum, a society that unabashedly teaches anti-Semitism through all means available, a society that puts suicide belts on children during political celebrations, a society that honors, glorifies and funds terrorists, a society that uses a hateful version of religion to poison the minds of its children, a society that engages in widespread jubilation when Jews are victims of terrorist attacks, is not a healthy society that can develop peace of any kind.","post_message":"#Israel's occupation forces in the #WestBank have used at least three Palestinian family homes as military posts in recent months"}]
