BUT, Trump showed more heart last night then any candidate I have seen; not because he wants power but because he cares for you & me. After seeing Lester Holt TRY to demolish trump, it did hit me, that the media does have power, and will do anything it takes to get what they want.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154284155303908","commenter_b":"Alexandria Lindquist Larry bought the lease for 14 million, Bumped up his policies just prior and netted a 4.5 bn dollar payout.

And you're telling me that the developers didn't take into account the possibility of the structures collapsing? I think they did.
