Palin said there was a double standard, stating actress Lena Dunham did not receive the same backlash after she revealed in her book that, as a child, she used ‘anything a sexual predator might do’ to bribe her young sister for kisses and more.   Palin began her rant on Facebook in all caps, writing \"HEY LENA, WHY NOT LAUGH OFF EVERYONE'S SEXUAL \"EXPERIMENTS\" AS YOU HAUGHTILY ENJOY REWARDS FOR YOUR OWN PERVERSION?

It will diminish drug trafficking and illegal entries. Trump has many options with regard to financing this colossal project. Furthermore, there will be no need to round up and deport millions. Simply register and background check everyone that is here illegally. Anyone beyond the dead line to register will be deported when discovered during routine traffic stops for example. The remainder should pay into the system until they complete the legal entry process, whatever that may be.","commenter_a":"Bryan NY Chow","post_message":"\"It's not only deportation.
