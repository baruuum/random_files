You think that if we can't tell the difference between refugees and terrorists, that we would actually be able to sort them out at the airport? If we didn't want to take refugees we should not have involved ourselves in the war.","commenter_a":"To the people who support bringing in Syrian refugees: Have you ever thought that some of these \"refugees\" could be disguised and actually be ISIS terrorists taking advantage of this situation with a free pass to get here? I think we need to use common sense and take the obvious security precautions and NOT accept these people!","post_message":"My interview last night with Sean Hannity."},{"comment_id":"10154433105862098","commenter_b":"@username girl there is plenty of those wanna be gringos😂😂😂","commenter_a":"👏👏👏👏👏they should removed trump he ain't capable to be president.
