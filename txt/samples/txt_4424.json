One, due to the fact that the prosecution will have to prove that an on duty officer was out there to kill someone, which won't happen. Two, for the fact that a vehicle is a deadly weapon and shooting a suspect using a vehicle in a manner that puts an officers life in danger is standard procedure and is taught in every academy in the U.S. This was a good shoot and the officer will be exonerated. But get ready to torch your local cvs for justice.","post_message":" is without question a murder, the prosecutor said about Sam Dubose's death.  didn do anything violent toward the officer.
