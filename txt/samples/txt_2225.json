We don't take care of people who are mentally ill. Rather (thanks to Reagan who closed the public hospitals) we either put them on the street, or we bake them first in prison, and *then* put them on the street.

It's time we realize the NRA and Republican cohorts are terrorist organizations and the Democrats are as guilty and cowardly to do anything to reign in this insanity, as they too are as beholden to NRA dollars as the Republicans.
