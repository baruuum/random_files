Hell I have family members that came here undocumented, but then did what they had to do to become citizens as fast as they could. I'm talking about the ones that come here and don't try.","commenter_a":"Smart or not, she needs to be deported, if she has not already applied for citizenship. Nobody ever said all undocumented immigrants were dumb, she's obviously not dumb by getting into Yale. Very sensitive subject.

But @username brings up a good point what are the consequences for this happening? Other then the fact she was shot! She should be fined and her gun license stripped until she completes a gun safety class! Even if she attended one in the first place to own her guns. She obviously wasn't paying attention when the part of trigger locks was brought up! But sadly she will probably not have to change anything about the way she practices gun safety and I'm sorry but that's wrong! Again she's lucky the kid didn't blow its own face off! I really think we should be able to own guns but not if you're not responsible about it! Gun owners are all jacked up about this but, every gun owner I know would never in a million years let this happen! Including you! You're ...","commenter_a":"I read the comments here from people laughing and saying they don't feel bad for this woman. You people are so filled with hate towards gun owners it's sickening. Yes this seams clear cut to me this woman didn't use common sense with her firearm I may even go as far to say she not to bright for leaving a firearm in reach of a kid But the hate that comes from you people I don't understand. What if she left a kitchen knife out and her kid hurt her with it Or had the kid in the car running and got run over by the child Would you all feel bad for her? We all make mistakes and Some worse than others but put you petty gun hate aside and give her a break.
