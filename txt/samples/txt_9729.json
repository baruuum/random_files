I saw my great grandmother suffer for other a year from emphysema that killed her very slowly. She started smoking at age 11 and didn't stop when she was 86 and still had O2 strapped to her face. Her lungs were almost solid black due to all the years of smoking. Its heartbreaking to have to watch your loved one suffocate in their own fluids all because of cigarettes... Seeing that I promised mysf I would never smoke, and I never have. Maybe I will get sick anyway, but at least I know I have the choice whether or not to expose myself to such a horrible toxin ridden thing. I still font understand why people ever pick one up knowing the effects on the body","post_message":"America's biggest #tobacco companies say they are ready and willing to pass along factual public health information about cigarettes."}]
