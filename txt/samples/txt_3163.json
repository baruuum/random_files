You have done more dirty deeds in your lifetime than one person can imagine. I love how you are like a child. You get called out for your own wrongdoings ( and then tell the FBI you have a concussion and cannot remember anything.. BS) so to take off the heat you try to point fingers at the other guy. If you win, American deserves what they get.","post_message":"In an exclusive interview with ABC News David Muir, Hillary Clinton calls for scrutiny of \"questionable\" Trump Foundation dealings in light of IRS fine: abcn.ws/2c4YKqd"},{"comment_id":"10152657458940047","commenter_b":"First get your children out of that muslim so called college.

Maybe you can sensationalize more Halloween hoarder homes while you're at it. I am glad Nickcole Dykema didn't actually hurt any Deputies (and she most likely could have, ambushing them in her own home like that), and glad the Deputies didn't kill her. This is a lesson for Police dealing w/ the mentally ill everywhere. I do hope this woman gets access to proper mental healthcare, and that through treatment she can find her way back into the world with peace and dignity.","post_message":"Multiple deputies received injuries at the \"house of horrors\"   From removing weapons from the \"booby trapped\" home"}]
