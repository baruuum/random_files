I translate that into, we will not get rid of our free labor (slaves) so secession was the choice, I can see where economics played into it, but to say slavery was not part of those same economics would be terribly ignorant. Lincoln maintained that secession was illegal thus unless south gave in war was inevitable.","commenter_a":"Here is an explanation of the civil war directly from the FEDERAL Government which proves without doubt that the War was NOT about slavery.

Although, she (as well as almost all teens that age I know whose frontal lobe isn't even completely developed and whose lack of life experience just isn't there no matter how much a teen thinks it is) is not ready to consent to domestic slavery, opps I mean marriage.
