Mumford & Sons had nothing to do with THE CITIES/RESIDENTS. You can't blame a band for the amount of fans they attract, they're grammy award winning musciams coming of a 2 year hiatus after releasng a long awaited album. The city is the problem here for using this \"cleanout method\" which they are literally treating these people, HUMAN BEINGS, like trash and obviously have no problem using terms that state that.
