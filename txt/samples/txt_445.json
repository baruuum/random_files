And roast a pig in the process.","commenter_a":"That is deplorable. He is entrusted to safeguard civilians, he does not have the right to pick and choose based on his personal beliefs and bigotry. One cannot condemn an entire religion because of a group of extremist radicals. EVERY religion has its bad...Catholics raping little boys, Christians murdering and blowing up abortion doctors and clinics. With the hateful logic all mosques should burn, burn all churches as well, right? I so sincerely hope he is removed from his station.

Does this effect me personally? Not really. But, it does effect my community/state/culture...whatever you want to call it. A day to celebrate pot? It's laughable to most. You can think I'm ignorant all you want, I still think it's ridiculous. Again, my opinion. Not sure why you feel the need to argue with me.","commenter_a":"Go to work. Volunteer.

That 1/2 had a crowd, the rest of the mall was sparsely filled but you could only see that from an ariel view. Crowd scientists say Trump's inauguration crowd was half the size of Obama's and they are correct, especially when you compare views of both ends of the mall--anyway--who really cares about this anymore?","commenter_a":"Obama was the first African American president I would expect the crowd to be quite larger for him","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"984298984944293","commenter_b":"üëèüëèüëèüëè","commenter_a":"For those of you patiently waiting on a squirrel update: According to Jeremy \"*UPDATE * the two suspect squirrels have moved into an older squirrel nest in the garden district of the property and decorated the heck out of it.
