That chicken, beef, bacon, etc. are almost from animals living in poor conditions and slaughtered. It's just favoritism to defend one animal and not another. To condemn one country and not another. Like Ramapriyan says, stop trying to be the world police.","commenter_a":"Just returned from Singapore and Hong Kong.

See picture here at @webpagelink Only thing that makes sense was that she was being fed the answers. That's why she sounded so scripted and robotic. Donald Trump was Presidential tonight. Hillary's \"in you face\" lies to the Veteran who asked the question about National Security cannot inspire confidence in the American public. How can anyone still support her? Trump is the only choice! America First is the plan!","post_message":"THANK YOU to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great!

Also the Muslim brotherhood. Look it up. He's also a lawyer who helps to bring in people illegally. Real \"good\"guy...and why was he attacking Trump? Trump did not want the war nor was he president or a senator who voted for the war. Nor is he the president now who has let ISIS run amok.","commenter_a":"He doesn't need to apologize. Hillary Clinton needs to apologize. If we did not go to Iraq their son would still be Alive. Hillary is to blame for running arms to muslim brotherhood. Khan attack Trump on national television.
