We shouldn't punish an innocent baby because of the sins of the father. I mean how many of us would be here if we were punished for the sins of our mothers and fathers?? Murdering your baby doesn't make you any less raped. My opinion is the morning after pill should be available with every rape kit.","post_message":"What the hell is wrong with this woman?"},{"comment_id":"10152911982215671","commenter_b":"Make sure you know the true story. I have never met the families that need their child taken. All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first. When you take children from their homes, good or bad homes, put them in counseling. Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."}]
