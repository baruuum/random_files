It will diminish drug trafficking and illegal entries. Trump has many options with regard to financing this colossal project. Furthermore, there will be no need to round up and deport millions. Simply register and background check everyone that is here illegally. Anyone beyond the dead line to register will be deported when discovered during routine traffic stops for example. The remainder should pay into the system until they complete the legal entry process, whatever that may be.","commenter_a":"Bryan NY Chow","post_message":"\"It's not only deportation.
