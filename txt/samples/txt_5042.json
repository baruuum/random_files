(In my case grandchildren). This testing bs in today's teaching in beyond rediculous. The \"common core\" math is crazy. My 12 yr old grandson just got a low grade in math and son in law said he doesn't understand it. There are mire letters than numbers in his math class. He is getting what we had in advanced 12th grade and it is just too difficult for that age to understand and too busy testing for tests to see what he doesn't understand. I pitty Florida kids in public school. Something needs to change before we lose more teachers like this.
