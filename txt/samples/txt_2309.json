Mike Flynn topped out at 24 days before resigning last night. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence claim they did not understand that Flynn was regularly in contact with Russian officials, including on the day Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the US election. That relationship could become the subject of investigation in Congress — at least one Republican, Marco Rubio, wants more information and has suggested combining it with a broader investigation into Russian meddling. To echo a Watergate-era inquiry from the late Sen. Howard Baker, “What did the president know and when did he know it?”"}]
