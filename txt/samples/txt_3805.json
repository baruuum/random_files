I'm sick of women pushing themselves to the front of every topic. And using their gender to advance themselves. We who have sons and brothers hate to see the way they are pushed to the back of the bus.","commenter_a":"I have listen to Rush for 20 years!! Love him!!

When? So far we've done nothing and the media's not reporting on stuff as ordered by our gay muslim prez! Meanwhile he's flying hundreds of thousands more in and setting up cells all over our Country.

Now.","commenter_a":"I get where the author is coming from and she makes a valid point. In this case though I think the mommy comments were engendered by Beyonce's show stopping 10 minute celebration of being black, being a woman, and being pregnant. Her presentation as an Isis figure/fertility goddess all flowed into the dynamic she created, so it's understandable that Adele and Faith related to her that way.
