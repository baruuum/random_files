Long before Trump ran for president i believed he is the man for the job. Smart, strong, dedicated and beyond all else brave enough to stand up for his vision and commitment, if anyone has what it takes to make change for the better it is Donald Trump. From all the way here in New Zealand - i have confidence in Donald Trump to clean up and create change.

Let's talk again when there's only days left of this nonsense.","commenter_a":"Jim Webb won this debate: he got more exposure out of the media tonight than he has had since he began his candidacy. Compared to Clinton he looks honorable, compared to Sanders he looks responsible. Since those two are the media darlings, those are the only two he needs to be compared to until he can get out of single digit polls. If any of those candidates expect to get moderate Independent and Republican voters next fall, they need Webb on the ticket‚Ä¶ unless Trump manages to stay in the race.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders defends his record on guns after Hillary Clinton pounces. #DemDebate"},{"comment_id":"709686039165167","commenter_b":"@username Illegals don't have insurance.","commenter_a":"Norway has a single payer health system as does every other civilized country in the world but us.
