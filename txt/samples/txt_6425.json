Repealing the 17th Amendment would take the money out of Senate elections on the federal level. Senators would be beholden to their state legislatures again rather than the corporatist class that lines their pockets, finances their re-election campaigns and ensures them seven-figure lobbying gigs once their time in “public service” ends. Senators would not act against their states, as 12 senators from 10 states are currently doing in regard to President Barack Obama’s executive action on amnesty for illegals. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"888341521222544","commenter_b":"She sounds worse than the other guy Holder.","commenter_a":"Another dumbass handpicked","post_message":"Add your name HERE: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153532246695779","commenter_b":"She looks ugly with that hairdo","commenter_a":"This was a beautiful version!
