Transgenders make up only .3% of the population so the threat from them is minimal. The threat from perverts who will abuse this decision to commit assaults will far outnumber the Transgenders who simply want to go pee. It will be the innocent among the majority of Target's customers that will face the consequences of Target's liberal, feel good decision.","commenter_a":"Well I guess my kids will not be using the fitting rooms.

Just think of how many tourists will flock to see this Great Wall of Mexico. Just like in China with their wall it could be worth millions of dollars every year to the Mexican economy. Also if he thinks that building this wall will stop people crossing the border into America every year from Mexico he's deluded what's he gonna do build it sky high to stop them coming in by air or build it around the coast to stop them coming in by sea and check every single shipping container coming into the country to make sure they aren't hiding inside or close off the border with Canada to make sure they haven't flown north first and are then coming in from the North. Get real people. This guy is deluded and the people who believe him are ...","commenter_a":"WTF !!!","post_message":"\"We will build a great wall along the southern border,\" Donald J.

Obama gives the border patrol and ICE orders to stand down all the time, which is a major contributing factor of the explosion in the illegal alien population in the US. The illegal population here is at an all-time high. There should never have been a healthcare mandate. This isn't a socialist regime. The people (or at least the majority of us) don't like the mandates, individual or business. I assert that you condoned Fast-N-Furious because you're the one who said things are better than they were \"under the misery of Bush\". Businesses salivated at the prospect of cheap labor, so when Bill Clinton signed NAFTA into law they didn't mind one bit firing millions of employees -many of whom had to seek any type of welfare they could in order to get by. Not good for economy ...","commenter_a":"You are MOST WELCOME here in the great state of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Mr. Trump!! I cannot WAIT to see you tomorrow!!
