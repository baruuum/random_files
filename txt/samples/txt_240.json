The C Level staff walk away with millions and everyone else has to suck it up.","post_message":"What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he was going to stand up for working people it turns out that Wall Street and Goldman Sachs are still running the show - and the Trump administration. Among many other billionaires in the Trump administration is Gary D. Cohn, the departing president of Goldman Sachs and Trump's new director of the National Economic Council. Upon leaving Goldman Sachs, Cohn just received an exit package of $285 million. Yes, $285 million.  And that's how the rigged economy and oligarchy works. The middle class of this country bailed out Goldman Sachs to the tune of over $800 billion. Goldman Sachs paid a $5 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury for illegal activity, as did virtually every other major bank. Meanwhile, no top Wall Street executive is prosecuted for criminal activity. Instead, the president of Goldman Sachs becomes the leading financial adviser to the President. And, to add insult to injury, Cohn and the Trump administration will soon end up supporting huge tax breaks for the rich while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Can we stop them? Yes. But only through a powerful and focused grassroots movement which tells Congress to represent us all, not just the 1 percent."},{"comment_id":"991707680869704","commenter_b":"Sorry ladies - simply not a fan and not willing to jump on her bandwagon because she seems to be the only female who's interested and has the ability to pursue it.","commenter_a":"Wouldn't vote for her if you paid me.","post_message":"If Republicans want to wage a war on women, they'll have to go through Hillary first."},{"comment_id":"583593931828899","commenter_b":"We Can't Let This Happen !

However we are definitely called to judge actions. In the case of same-sex marriage to support same-sex marraige is to supoort something that goes against the Bible's definition of marraige. Same-sex marraige is social, cultural, and traditional. Social, cultural and traditional acceptance will change with time but Biblical truth does not. Therefore I believe that we are to love everyone but support what is right in the eyes of the Lord.","post_message":"Brenda Wood 11Alive looks back at the fast-moving and historic events of last week in Monday's Last Word -- \"Same-sex marriage: Judgement Day.\"  More Last Words: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"579876898863510","commenter_b":"that chick with the bad bouttabe me in a second","commenter_a":"How cooked Darnell Fraser-Carroll Darnell Rea","post_message":"Ghosts from The Ring and Grudge opened a Japanese baseball game"},{"comment_id":"997724686914554","commenter_b":"Natenyahu, be a man and accept refugees to Israel!","commenter_a":"Hungry is right!","post_message":"A Syrian father laid to rest his wife and his two little boys in Kobani after they drowned as they tried to flee to Europe.
