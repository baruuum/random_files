Transgenders make up only .3% of the population so the threat from them is minimal. The threat from perverts who will abuse this decision to commit assaults will far outnumber the Transgenders who simply want to go pee. It will be the innocent among the majority of Target's customers that will face the consequences of Target's liberal, feel good decision.","commenter_a":"Well I guess my kids will not be using the fitting rooms.

Obama gives the border patrol and ICE orders to stand down all the time, which is a major contributing factor of the explosion in the illegal alien population in the US. The illegal population here is at an all-time high. There should never have been a healthcare mandate. This isn't a socialist regime. The people (or at least the majority of us) don't like the mandates, individual or business. I assert that you condoned Fast-N-Furious because you're the one who said things are better than they were \"under the misery of Bush\". Businesses salivated at the prospect of cheap labor, so when Bill Clinton signed NAFTA into law they didn't mind one bit firing millions of employees -many of whom had to seek any type of welfare they could in order to get by. Not good for economy ...","commenter_a":"You are MOST WELCOME here in the great state of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Mr. Trump!! I cannot WAIT to see you tomorrow!!

All my friends would describe themselves as feminists (male and female). None of them support Trump. Funny that.","commenter_a":"The insult 'a basket of deplorables', is the best exhibit of Hillary Clinton discriminating personality. There is a big number of registered democrats (like myself) for Donald J. Trump. So all democrats and independents (forget the republicans) supporting Trump, are that? That is how cheat this woman is. If elected, she will do the same to any ethnic group rejecting her, and will blow up one country after another, starting with Russia. Deplorable, is Hillary Clinton for expressing herself that way about the 75% of US citizens.
