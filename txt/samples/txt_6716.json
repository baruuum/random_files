Maybe you skipped the part in school that teaches you to be human and love humanity. You can disagree with political views but when you just get mean spirited about a person...thats just wrong!! I think Americans need more love and a lot less hate!!!! Next time you call someone something, look into the mirror and see if you ever sinned yourself. \"Those without sin...cast the first stone\"!!","post_message":"A smiling Hillary Clinton just arrived on Capitol Hill for meetings with Democratic lawmakers. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"903279336444237","commenter_b":"Sigh","commenter_a":"Joshua William Grant told you ðŸ˜‚","post_message":"Misogyny is misogyny."},{"comment_id":"533721010147110","commenter_b":"Or maybe we should learn from history instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over. Illegal immigration didn't work out too great for the Native Americans. Has illegal immigration worked out for any culture? We all have a set of keys for our lives, hence I believe we all can agree on a measure of security. I say who comes into my home, you say who is allowed into your home.

Donald Trump has every right to his opinion. I agree that this country has had an influx of illegals for years. Be informed and know that Mexico and Guatemala have cut a deal to send thousands more to cross our borders illegally. The monies they send back to Mexico and Guatemala is $120 Billion dollars. This president wants to give them a free pass plus $35 thousand tax refunds? So they cross illegally, burden our health centers, schools, and oh only so you get my disgust! All I used to hear at the hospital is people telling other relatives of theirs to \"Come to the U.S., because this country is so stupid. They give you money for living, food stamps and oh if you have your babies in the U.S. , then they are citizens and you can stay\"... So these so called nice people ...","commenter_a":"Its a PR move.
