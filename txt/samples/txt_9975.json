Which would have highlighted not only the DNC favoritism of Clinton, but of the fact that they have been working to shut down Bernie at every turn. Which would have meant public acknowledgement of Bernie actually having a chance to win.","post_message":"Bernie Sanders sued, and the Democratic National Committee backed off, but it's not over yet."},{"comment_id":"779978185438256","commenter_b":"And she is responsible for 100s of men being killed.","commenter_a":"In the Commander In Chief Debate tonight, wondered if anyone noticed that Hillary was wearing an earpiece.
