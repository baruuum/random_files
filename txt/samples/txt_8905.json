It is also obvious that there will be another attack here in America and Washington is doing nothing to stop it. Their solution is to take our guns away from us so we have no means of protection what so ever. America wake up! We must get rid of Obama before he gets us all killed, it is just that simple!!!","post_message":"We know ISIS wants to infiltrate our homeland, yet our borders remain unsecured.

That is a reflection of voters failing to elect officials who actually do their job. Our government was originally structured in order to make congress the most powerful branch. Unfortunately, modern Americans think the president holds all of the power and are far too ignorant of what their congressmen are doing. Despite an approval rating below 40%, reelection rates within congress are still at 96%. That is your problem, not the president. Granted, Obama doesn't really help matters, but even as a republican I must concede that it isn't ALL his fault, and quite honestly regardless of the fact that he is a poor president there are no grounds for impeachment.","commenter_a":"Why don't you impeach this man. History is going to show this congress as the most inept and corrupt congress in history and is being complicit in the destruction of our country by inaction","post_message":"Mandatory voting? \"The president whose major policy achievement is mandatory health insurance thinks maybe voting should be mandatory, too.\" What do you think?"}]
