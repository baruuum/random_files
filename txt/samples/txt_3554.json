I saw my great grandmother suffer for other a year from emphysema that killed her very slowly. She started smoking at age 11 and didn't stop when she was 86 and still had O2 strapped to her face. Her lungs were almost solid black due to all the years of smoking. Its heartbreaking to have to watch your loved one suffocate in their own fluids all because of cigarettes... Seeing that I promised mysf I would never smoke, and I never have. Maybe I will get sick anyway, but at least I know I have the choice whether or not to expose myself to such a horrible toxin ridden thing. I still font understand why people ever pick one up knowing the effects on the body","post_message":"America's biggest #tobacco companies say they are ready and willing to pass along factual public health information about cigarettes."},{"comment_id":"949797868421279","commenter_b":"Funny more women looking to have affairs on there then men","commenter_a":"Huffington Post UK, bad for those men, they cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...\" ? The point of a dating site is to meet potential partners, usually of the opposite sex. How many women are subscribed to Ashley Madison I wonder? Oh, wait. I forgot! If a woman is on a site like this it can't be because she is a \"cheating dirtbag\"! It must be because she is \"exploring female empowerment\". Both sexes have a sex drive that can override sensible decision making processes. Both men and women are equally capable of cheating on their partners, so please The Huffington Post drop the \"all men are evil\" act and think before you type!","post_message":"“Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...\" Ashley Madison"},{"comment_id":"754556321401612","commenter_b":"Tie them by their ankles to a fast moving train!!","commenter_a":"This is the mine set of Muslims.

Grew to be a man, ministered to people healing the sick, performing miracles, teaching about God's Kingdom. Was rejected by His own Jewish people, suffered and died on a cross. Arose from the grave the 3rd day, talked and ate with His disciples, talked to 500 people before ascending into Heaven to sit at the right hand of God, and to prepare a place for us. If we accept Jesus as the Son of God, repent of our sins, God is gracious to forgive us and save us from eternal death. We will live in peace and love and joy in our eternal life.
