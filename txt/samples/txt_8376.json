This is why I wrote, death penalty for killers. Killers should know that gas chamber is their end. But when the law starts making up excuses for their actions, every law goes out the window. Illegals guns hit the streets because its about money. When someone chooses to be stupid, is not about money, the culprit list will be long, and everybody should be hold accountable. So, should we shot everybody and ask later? There are some people who are paying the consequences for not thinking ahead, trying to uphold the laws in their hands, like some kind of hero.
