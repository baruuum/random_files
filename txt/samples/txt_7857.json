My point is why go to a frat house that is known for Alcohol drugs and loose women having sex up stairs, when you know inappropriate things always happen in places like that. Secondly, I'm sure she was there drinking in an unsafe environment but I don't condone anyone being raped but we should ask ourselves why the Hell do women keep going to places that are historically unsafe for women? Lastly, women lie so much about rape and other things that no one knows when they are telling the truth. There has been several times when men have been falsely accused of rape and we found out later that she was just trying to cover up the fact that she decided to sleep with the whole football team at once. I see the police reports ...","commenter_a":"Ok but why was she even there in the first place?!!!!!!

Repealing the 17th Amendment would take the money out of Senate elections on the federal level. Senators would be beholden to their state legislatures again rather than the corporatist class that lines their pockets, finances their re-election campaigns and ensures them seven-figure lobbying gigs once their time in “public service” ends. Senators would not act against their states, as 12 senators from 10 states are currently doing in regard to President Barack Obama’s executive action on amnesty for illegals. @webpagelink"}]
