With all due respect to the court, it did not define marriage, and therefore is not entitled to re-define it. Long before our government came into existence, marriage was created by the One who created man and womanAlmighty Godand His decisions are not subject to review or revision by any manmade court. God is clear about the definition of marriage in His Holy Word: a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24). I pray God will spare America from His judgment, though, by our actions as a nation, we give Him less and less reason to do so.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"927501820717545","commenter_b":"Perfectly stated.","commenter_a":"Translation: \"I am begging all my supporters, that despite conning you into voting for me, you need to come to DC.
