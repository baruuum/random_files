Unfortunately not in all.","commenter_a":"Happy would be happier with other elephants. However (if you read the article), her buddy Grumpy was killed by the other two elephants when they charged him. The Bronx Zoo is not bringing in any more elephants and would put Happy at risk with the two they have. She does need to be moved to another zoo. Maybe they all do, but there is no guarantee she will be accepted with other elephants. Sad, but maybe it's time to focus on getting rid of zoo's altogether and leave these animals in their natural habitat where they belong.","post_message":"For close to a decade Happy has lived alone, separated from the zooâ€™s 2 other elephants. Her solitary existence is quite unlike the life of a wild elephant."},{"comment_id":"10153256940195736","commenter_b":"God forbid we put them in shelters and feed them.","commenter_a":"I have advocated for helping the homeless for a decade but it has gotten out of hand over the last couple years...which is to be expected, given we've mostly ignored the problem. These folks belong in Wapato and Wapato needs to be converted into a mental health care site.. They commit crimes against society -- leaving garbage around is just a visible symptom but when folks aren't looking, they misbehave in more destructive ways. They need to be \"rebooted,\" in the computer sense, not the kick-in-the-pants sense. Though some of them need that as well...","post_message":"Mayor Hales said today was the first of several in which the homeless will be moved out of city parks."},{"comment_id":"10154944041488700","commenter_b":"They are ALL criminals!!
