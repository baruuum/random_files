Why would a progressive vote for her?","commenter_a":"These Sanders supporters that would rather see a Trump presidency were never Bernie supporters, they were Hillary haters. Any progressive ideas or policies would be set back decades with a Trump presidency. Not to mention how far back we would be set back with a conservative tilted SCOTUS.

We know by looking at her past experience and seeing it limited to special interest. She has almost no relevant experience. Cabinet members are to be experts in their field, not solely a wealthy donor to republicans. This is not a try out situation. There is not a revote. Your assessment of Trump's hiring practices ignore what we've seen even during his campaign. He had to find new campaign managers three times.","commenter_a":"Who in his right mind would approve of her, doesn't matter if you come from the left or right, everyone can see she is unfit for the job","post_message":"Senators are expected to vote Tuesday on the nomination of Betsy DeVos for education secretary.
