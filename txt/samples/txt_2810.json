The immigration process can always be improved but, to give out amnesty to the illegals is like saying don't worry about the long waits in line; hundreds of dollars spent on forms; and the months it takes to swear in as a US citizen. If illegal immigrants want amnesty then pick a number; pay a penalty, and follow the process including all the fees. People who are following the rules are deeply wronged by illegals jumping the line by receiving amnesty.","commenter_a":"God Bless Donald Trump as he is our next real President.","post_message":"Press Conference LIVE"}]
