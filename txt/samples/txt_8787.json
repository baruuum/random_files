In America there is a certain ownership in marriages rather than partnership. Maybe she loves him as a man and equal in mind, the fact that he does have a wandering eye (penis) may be something she is willing to accept the way we accept a partner's handbag obsession.... Just saying....","post_message":"The end of a relationship – even a years-long marriage, even an otherwise-good relationship, even with children in the mix – is, at this point, the only acceptable consequence of infidelity, and staying is posited as the inexplicable choice for a woman to make.

Unless you have lost a child no one can even imagine the heart break they feel right now.
