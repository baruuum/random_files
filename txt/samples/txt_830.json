(In my case grandchildren). This testing bs in today's teaching in beyond rediculous. The \"common core\" math is crazy. My 12 yr old grandson just got a low grade in math and son in law said he doesn't understand it. There are mire letters than numbers in his math class.

I pitty Florida kids in public school. Something needs to change before we lose more teachers like this.
