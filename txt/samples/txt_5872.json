Not sure but to me this seems like a modern take on that...in most cases such dancing is done for the benefit of men. But when it is done to express one's sexuality in a personal way, it does have an empowering effect. It suggests that a woman's sexuality belongs to her and doesn't need a male audience to be valid.","post_message":"I never thought a pole-dancing video could be such a tearjerker.

Isis has definitely scared a lot of people. It would be nice if the Muslim community would make a statement in response to the killings around the world. Just to declare they are different of the terrorist and that what Isis has done is wrong. Then I think there would be a better understanding of Muslims. But even still there will remain evil people , like this man at Kroger. I'm constantly praying for our world. The world needs love. The world needs God. Blacks against whites. Whites against Arabs. Muslim against christian. Oh God help us all!!!!!","commenter_a":"Kelly Sleiman!!!!!","post_message":"Dearborn Police are investigating the beating of an Arab American man inside a local grocery store.

Question for Obama, if the wealthiest 1% is forced to pay their fair share as you say are they more likely to sacrifice their life style to pay the tax hike with or slash the payroll aka are jobs to pay for it ? And if given the choice between getting the rich to pay ( again as you say) their fair share or having a job to provide for my family, I'll take the latter every time!!","post_message":"This administration has failed to prioritize job creation and economic opportunity. The Washington culture may be fundamentally broken, but the American spirit that built this great nation is not. America's leaders should be working to ensure every person who wants a job, has a job. That’s what this is about – making sure mothers and fathers can provide for their families and our children have every opportunity to pursue their dreams. #SOTU"},{"comment_id":"10156869276120725","commenter_b":"Thank you Wisconsin! #TRUMPTRAIN #makeamericagreatagain","commenter_a":"The era of appeasement is coming to an end!
