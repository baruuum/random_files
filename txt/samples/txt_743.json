How many more innocent people have to die before we regulate gun control?

It's time for gun regulations NOW!!!! 😒😞 I understand that there's no way you can get criminals to obey the laws, that's why they are \"criminals \" because they break the laws but we need to make it a little more difficult for them to get their hands on a gun like they did in Australia in 1996 after a mass shooting there .... Law abiding citizens still should have their rights to own a gun for protection hunting and recreation. @webpagelink","post_message":" politics has to change.
