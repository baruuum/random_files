The terror experienced in Paris for one night is what they go through on a day to day basis and you want to send them away? Have some empathy, what if it was you and your child fleeing this barbarism? Turning them away is no better than away Jewish refugees during WW2 (see SS St. Louis). How anyone can see their suffering and simply ignore it or tell them to leave defies any and all tenants of a Christian faith, humanity, and what America stands for.","post_message":"How very Christian of them."}]
