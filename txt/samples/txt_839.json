Yet why is it that while people...especially GOPers LOVE to scream bloody murder and point their fingers at those threatening to take away their guns and insist they not be persecuted the same way women who have abortions, gay men and women and birth control is seen as the devils idea. Guns kill people, The LGBT community hurts no one...all we want are equal rights and legal marriage, abortion in most cases saves unwanted children from being abused or just dumped in the trash and the GOP Congress has been trying to withhold food, shelter and a chance at a normal life from those born to poor unwed women. Where are those men and women when they see poor unnourished children who most likely are not wanted some being abused some being killed and some just starving to death. Instead ...","commenter_a":"To all those saying we have no gun problem - please review our statistics on mass shootings. We have more than the next few countries combined. And to those saying gun restrictions would not help because criminals would still get guns anyway: if you limit something at its source, if there are less guns being sold, period, statistically all criminals would have a much tougher time getting a gun. People with a history of physical violence and mental illness SHOULD NOT have access to guns, and today most can simply walk into a store and buy one as easily as anyone else - anyone who argues with these facts is part of the problem.","post_message":"What is standing in the way of meaningful gun reform?"},{"comment_id":"892830167500429","commenter_b":"Well when you're being raped - tell me about that theory again or in a 'dickless' gun free zone.

An officer was called since a teacher cannot physically remove a student from a classroom. The officer asked her to come with him, she refused and pushed him. She had then assaulted a police officer. Which is an arrest-able offense. She then resists arrest while further assaulting the officer (hitting him). Why does anyone think this is ok? These children have no respect for authority. I see most people defending her. Seriously?","post_message":"This guy can bench press 605 pounds, and he threw that tiny girl across the room.
