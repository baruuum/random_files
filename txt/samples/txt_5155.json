I have been amazed by the number of employers threatening to leave and all the other boycotts. At least I still don't have to worry about a man walking into the friggin ladies room.

Unfortunately, that's nothing new and despite all the changes in the way our society views and treats women today, they are still objectified. Some women today even objectify themselves- Beyonce, the Kardashians, many others who make themselves sex objects in order to \"succeed\".

So if you're shocked or offended at Trump's words, you've been living under a rock. There are tens of thousands of men who think and talk like him and they're your fathers, brothers, husbands, co-workers, bosses, judges, CEOs, doctors, lawyers, cops and US Presidents. It's nothing new and it will never change.","commenter_a":"Sad for her. He is such a shameful person.","post_message":"JUST IN: Melania Trump issues statement following release of husband Donald J.
