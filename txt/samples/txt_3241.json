It seems like they only invited you on the show to badger you. Whoopi is worse than Bill O'Reilly. She kept interrupting you & would not let you get your point across, and Joy just laughed at everything you said like it was some kind of a joke. They don't care about their guests' viewpoints at all. I have to say that I admire you for being the great person that you are.","commenter_a":"Thank you, Dr. Carson, for remaining the gentleman you are while on The View today. I must say I stopped watching that show years ago. I watched today because you were on. I have great respect and admiration for you. Donald Trump is not my first choice for President. I will vote for him if he is the Republican nominee. Maybe some of your calmness, thinking before you speak, will rub off on Donald if he is nominated and elected President. The women of The View are not my cup of tea. I turned the show off as soon as your segment was over.","post_message":"I would like to thank the Ladies of The View for having me on. Though we disagree on politics, the beautiful thing about America is that we're able to have platforms where we can discuss those differences. I will continue to work hard to ensure that this remains for generations to come."},{"comment_id":"1023375851016759","commenter_b":"You're wasting every body else's.","commenter_a":"67 out of the HOW MANY THOUSANDS of people that visit daily?
