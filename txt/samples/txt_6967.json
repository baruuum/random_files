You're a suffering liberal.","commenter_a":"This is big news because conservatives want you NOT to notice that the economy is way up, the deficit is way down, unemployment claims are at a 42 year low, and Obama has unprecedented world approval. So Obama has almost rescued us from the disaster the Republicans left us when Bush was in office. But don't notice that stuff, focus on bathrooms and what Muslims are doing in countries you can't even find on a map.","post_message":"#BoycottTarget  #PRDisaster #TalkIsCheap"},{"comment_id":"448351221956139","commenter_b":"I'm from Texas and Perry has done a good job for jobs and everything else, except shutting the border down.

Police and other security people cannot be everywhere to ensure nothing ever goes wrong. It's just common sense to use caution and good judgment when out alone.","post_message":"FRIGHTENING VIDEO:  A woman who pulled up to an ATM was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced into her trunk and the whole ordeal was caught on video ---> @webpagelink  The suspect even gave police a good look at him"},{"comment_id":"1048428675208939","commenter_b":"@username What are you reading? How did the US government start this war? The Syrians and everyone else out in North Africa and the Middle East have access to the internet and make their own decisions. When people have access to information freely they act accordingly. People have free will to think and make decisions. No one forced the Syrians to fight or oust Assad. He cracked down on protests violently and this is the result.","commenter_a":"How can Assad sleep at night knowing he is responsible for the deaths of 300,000+ of his own people.

I'm tired of all of the meth head thieves , I can't even imagine how many children across America are going through the same life endangering situations becouse of the parents being hooked on meth .. don't spend the tax payers money on jail , send them to treatment for several months . I'm sure these parents were decent human beings before meth took over . Unfortunately now they have like all meth heads done sinister,and incomprehensible acts . It's good to see these kids have survived when so many others don't .","post_message":"Bond's set at $100,000 for each parent after they allegedly abandoned their three young children in a house that neighbors call a mess and fire hazard.   \"Rats that were running in and out of the garage.
