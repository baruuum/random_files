He wants immigrants gone, he should be the first to leave. Give this land back to native American people, the earth was pure and clean.

Not only was this guy scoping out gay bars before, he also chose to go on Latinx night, when most of the patrons were PoC, generally of Latin descent. So this was a hate crime. It had to do with race, it had to do with sexual orientation. You trying to bury those facts is deplorable.","commenter_a":"This isn't a gay attack. It's a terrorist attack that's being portrayed as homophobic because that's a cause people will rally for. Anything to further your agenda. No one wants to believe it's radical Islam, but that's what this is. Of course his family and even his own tweets blame gays. A gay bar is a perfect target so we can blame homophobes and call it a a hate crime. Well terror is also a hate crime and gay or straight these people are dead.","post_message":"President Obama on Sunday morning's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

Crime Bill vote, wasn't for gay marriage because he thought it was a 'states rights' issue. Voted to send Vermonts nuclear waste to a small latino poor town in Texas. Voted to FUND the war in Iraq and plenty of other wars. Couldn't even to get the members of the Progressive Caucus in congress, that he started, to support him. You lost. Get over it.","commenter_a":"Of course he can't give Hillary credit for winning on her own merits. It must be because of closed primaries, or \"the poor not voting,\" or whatever other excuse he can come up with. How about the fact that Bernie benefited from the caucus system in certain states that actually make it difficult for voters to participate & thereby lower turnout? I don't hear Hillary whining about that. #feelthewhine","post_message":"He's looking ahead."}]
