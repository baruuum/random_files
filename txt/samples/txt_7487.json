Those are not just mare refugees those are economic migrants that seek to invade Europe and it's borders in order to establish themselves on our continent! They are not here because they need help, they are not here because they are running from War, those are people that abandoned their country , their women and children in order to Exploit Our achievements. To Abuse our LAWS in order to gain access to benefits we have worked for decades! They do not seek help nor assistance nor do they want to return to their country after the War ends. They want to Infiltrate our culture , our lands and when they gain critical mass we will not be able not only to stop them but to even contain them and make them obey the Laws in the countries they live in.

If we must be told of the killing, we are told they are necessary to defend the way and . Because U.S. life is subsidized worldwide (and within the United States by people of color and poor White labor), racism must exist or else the entire edifice crumbles... . Race is not only necessary, but also a central tenet of westward expansion, for Western imperialism and capitalism are intimately tied to White superiority\" (Christopher Knaus \"More White Supremacy? The Lord of the Rings as Pro-American Imperialism\" Multicultural Perspectives, 7(4), 54-58. 2005).","commenter_a":"\"Who the United States considers to be evil is certainly not winning in reality. Poor, starving, bombed out women and children in Iraq and Afghanistan are not winning. The women working 16-hr workdays in sweat-shops in Thailand, the Philippines, Jamaica, and Mexico are not winning. The victims of human trafficking in New York, Florida, and Texas are not winning. Those with AIDS in Africa are not winning. The billions of poor people of color throughout the world are not winning. And yet we have set up an entire system of imperialized globalization, which we call democracy to keep them from winning. So we are, in fact, winning, although we only win because we have obscured not only what we are fighting for, but also whom we are fighting against\" (Knaus).","post_message":"Question of the Day: Which Republican presidential candidate do you think will be the toughest on radical Islamists?"},{"comment_id":"10154680917183352","commenter_b":"What these women would really look like without the weave an fake eyes an their natural color so much plastic they can make Tupper ware","commenter_a":"Are you removing that photo method man asked you to remove?","post_message":"BREAKING: T.I.’s Wife Tiny Reportedly Caught on Video Fighting and Beating Her Husband’s Alleged Mistress! ---> @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153810976206680","commenter_b":"Lock that vandal up!","commenter_a":"Way better than perjury charges, obstruction of justice, mishandling of classified documents, racketeering (Hillary) or fraud charges (Trump.)
