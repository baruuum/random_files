Ban all guns in the U.S. it will make us safer but keep the borders open so when the black market opens the guns can flow in like water. On an ending note; Police are in no way obligated to protect you from any threat per the Supreme Court so I guess when they do show up they can draw that chalk outline around your fresh corpse.","commenter_a":"Blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit out of all the diehard ammosexual blowhards who love their guns. Europe doesn't have the problems we have in the country with guns. Neither does Canada or Australia. You want to believe what you want to believe. Follow the money. It's the NRA who wants you to keep your guns and fills your head with nonsense that you're just too willing to believe because you have no balls and tiny dicks. Try thinking about things instead of just buying into the rhetoric. The USA is safer now than at any other time in history. Why do you need them? Why focus on fairy tales like imagined revolutions against the government instead of focusing on things that are ACTUALLY happening like kids being killed in schools by LEGALLY OWNED GUNS.","post_message":"A company that worked on â€˜Taken 3â€™ with Liam Neeson didnâ€™t take kindly to his comments about the U.S."},{"comment_id":"635677536633830","commenter_b":"Demons","commenter_a":"@username read the top comment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚","post_message":"Name it!  #WSHH"},{"comment_id":"10153929399138598","commenter_b":"she does NOT belong in prison","commenter_a":"You pig","post_message":"Woman Who Killed Her 25-Week-Old Unborn Baby and Threw Him in Dumpster Appeals Conviction"},{"comment_id":"905881252841461","commenter_b":"Frigging Brainless Teabaggers!","commenter_a":"Wait, he's flying to Florida with all that has to travel with the president to give a speech about Earth Day?
