Whether or not you believe the Crusades were meant to stop Islamic atrocities or to spread Christianity, that should not be the focus here. Suggestion: Truly read the differences between Christianity and the Islamic faiths and decide which spreads peace within its holy scriptures.... An interesting example below siting scripture from both religions (read in its entirety). ...Especially, the Ellen Mems comparison.

You can home school, live in a tent, even be homeless. There were other reasons. Living in filth, broken glass, all stated in a copy of the letter the mom posted to her Facebook.
