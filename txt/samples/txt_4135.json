No questions just stomp them and dump them back across the border.","commenter_a":"She just deserve a raspberry. It is the to be said to her. Our immigration system needs work but she is really talking about letting illegal aliens in. The term illegal means we have acknowledged that they have committed a non-legal act, thus becoming a criminal. That means do not pass Go do not collect 200 dollars. They are already being coddled at our expense. If, they are caught they should be taken direct to be fingerprinted and photographed, then directly to a border. If, they are identified as having done it before. We should setup a location far away to ship them to. This non-American needs to mind her own business, instead of trying to shovel her troubles on to us.","post_message":"Oh really?"}]
