The reason that women cannot be priests is that the priest acts in the person of Christ in the Mass. If it's a woman offering the Mass the sacrifice becomes one of bride to bride - and the significance is lost. Humans are sensual creatures. God knew that; that's why He created sensual experiments (the Sacraments) as visible signs of His grace. You cannot baptize someone with motor oil because it's not a sign of cleansing. Similarly, you cannot ordain a woman. It is not possible.","commenter_a":"st paul says there is no difference between men and women now that we are in Christ Jesus. there is nothing to suggest that women cannot be ordained priests or deacons from the mouth of Jesus himself. the fact that only men were chosen by him could be due to the fact that the social fabric of his day could not tolerate or make it possible otherwise. the holy spirit will continue to guide the church according to christ's own promise. let's not bar the way forward when we see he is driving along that path. we need to go to the spirit of our faith and not be kept back by men made rules and practices. WE HAVE TO LET THE LORD SPEAK.....AND LET US BE SILENT.","post_message":"The Catholic Church can never ordain women priests, so why all the confusing signals?"},{"comment_id":"826344630889447","commenter_b":"We are sick and ;tierd of feeding these lazy women who just keep laying on their backs , letting free loaders get them Pregnant.
