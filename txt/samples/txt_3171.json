If they come to just spread their own countries ideals that conflict with the ideals of the USA, then why come at all? As for who said anything about Sharia Law...that is one of the biggest current issues with immigrants going to the US. They believe in it. They shouldn't be in our country if they do.","commenter_a":"What a wonderful way to make immigrants feel welcome (ps: that's sarcasm) or perhaps immigrants aren't really welcome? In your hearts do you hate people who haven't been born here or speak with an accent or celebrate holidays differently than you do?

Perhaps to show he is working in good faith, don't you think he should have them manufactured here in the US? It is quite simple to say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that but it is far more difficult to actually do them. He might say it, if elected he might try and do it but I guarantee you he is not going to \"make\" the Mexicans pay for his wall, a wall that will actually do little to stop the flow of illegals. The gun he will hold to the Mexicans head to make ...","commenter_a":"Trump wants to build a wall on the border and make Mexico pay for it, deport illegals, cut taxes on the middle class and corporations, destroy Isis, take care of our veterans, strengthen our military, build the keystone pipeline, repeal Common Core, repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market based system, stop SS and welfare fraud, fight Mexico and China unfair trade and currency practices, preserve the sanctity of the unborn life, preserve the sanctity of the 2nd amendment ... that's conservatism ... that's patriotism ... that's what it will take to bring America back to greatness","post_message":"Take a look at the companies that are partnering with this pro-amnesty open-borders group!   @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"563277980487645","commenter_b":"What's the difference between Trumps wife's and illegal immigrants?
