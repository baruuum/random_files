That's the only way we will rid society of ALL the barbaric Bronze Age religions that have no place in the 21st century...","commenter_a":"At last someone actually making a speech about the idea that wearing a headscarf doesn't necessarily mean that women are (always) submissive, that it's part of a culture as well, and that not ALL women are forced to wear them. Ten years ago and even before i used to be seen as an alien if i said that, not being a Muslim myself. pppffff Yes!! let them get on with their lives, and us ours!","post_message":"\"We need to create the space to hear Muslim women for who they are individually and not to judge them merely as a monolithic community.\""},{"comment_id":"10153279901571955","commenter_b":"Good!

Our city sales tax is 10.25 per cent. I voted for this sales increase to pay for the improvements that put my city on the list of one of the best cities to live. Low crime, lush, great shopping, great roads, many services, about 15 parks, good schools and I live in a well kept condo complex where my HOA dues are over 300.00. The only blight I ever see are the smelly, stained mattresses and unwanted cheap furniture that slobs leave next to the more than amble sized trash areas. They dump in the middle of the night bec they're too cheap to pay to have them hauled away properly. My neighbors and I have concluded it is the renters here. They have no stake in keeping up the complex. The HOA pays for the removal weekly. The trash man ...","commenter_a":"Disgraceful.","post_message":"Do you have a discarded mattress on your block?

And so where the bigoted bakers, Faith is not an excuse to treat others poorly. You say murder is never okay yet both books are full of it. You are intolerant of both the bible and the Koran. Yet you somehow think a bigoted bakers faith is an excuse? That's a double standards","commenter_a":"The intolerance level for religion on this thread is too dang high! Get yourselves together. If you're going to claim \"BE TOLERANT\" to things, you gotta be tolerant to religion also. They will always exist. There will always be someone or some thing to worship or praise. Spirituality is a great thing. It brings positivity to people's lives. There's nothing wrong with that.","post_message":"But the story isn't as simple as nature versus religion, experts say."}]
