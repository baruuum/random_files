Why should we have to be subjected to her cop bashing, Black Panther, Malcolm X etc. opinions. That's not talent. Perhaps we should go back to marching bands and perhaps you should think about reporting the news or even better retiring.","commenter_a":"Wow these comments are funny to me. Beyonce did not give a hateful message. You all are upset because of what you saw visually and what the media has told you what she is singing about. Have any of you even listened to the song or listened to her response to the media turning her song into hate? And she and her husband have done a lot for the black community. They just don't have the media around to show it because that is not what it's all about.","post_message":"Brenda's Last Word on Beyonce's so-called 'way too political' Super Bowl performance.
