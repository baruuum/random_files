Women should not be offended, but rather look at the monster joke. A man that has not completed his surgery is woman of the year. What a joke. Gentleman the majority of us would never want to be a man. We are happy with ourselves. I feel sorry for this mockery of a woman and an insult to men in general.","post_message":"Female Marine goes off on Bruce Jenner for winning 'Woman Of The Year' Award. She's right.

The USA is goin to shit","commenter_a":"Most of the people commenting here have no concept of freedom. The beauty of America is if you don't like the way one busines does thongs, you can go to another. Using government to force people to comply is not Freedom. Should a gay baker be forced to make a cake for an anti gay group? This is a continuing attack on the rights of American's in general, just like telling businesses the can't smoke in them anymore. Just because a business is open to the public does not mean every person has a right to frequent there no matter what.","post_message":"How do YOU feel about this case? Should government be able to force businesses to do things against their will by writing legislation? What do YOU think?"}]
