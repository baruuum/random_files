That poor little boy knew there were people out there that could help him, and then realized how bad he was being failed by everyone","post_message":"In testimony during the preliminary hearing, teacher Jennifer Garcia said in the months before Gabriel Fernandez's death, she repeatedly reported to county child service workers new signs of abuse that prosecutors say came at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend.   In one instance, Gabriel came to school with swollen eyes and a pockmarked face, she said. At first, he said he had fallen, but he then told her,  mom shot me in the face with a BB gun, she testified.  On two occasions, she testified, a fearful Gabriel asked,  you call that lady?, referring to the county social worker. But as months passed, and the boy remained with his mother, Garcia said she began to lose confidence in child protective services."},{"comment_id":"1172394232854914","commenter_b":"Hell yes !....
