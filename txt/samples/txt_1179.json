There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems.

I would not turn away of I walked into a place of business and seen club memebrs in the same place. They don't just go out and rob and kill people because they want to.
