Basically the way it would work though is if impeachment is not possible, a no confidence vote by congress could in effect say we no longer recognize this Presidents authority. Members of congress can be sanctioned, why not the POTUS?","commenter_a":"What we need is Nation wide non-compliance with, or recognition of authority, or any further orders coming out of the White House. Personally I think a no confidence vote is in order. Write your Congress and demand the sanctioning of the President until the end of his term, for gross executive over reach and abuse of power.","post_message":"The president continues to show his disregard for millions of Americans with his 'Bathroom Order,' never bothering to consult with parents.
