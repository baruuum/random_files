Not only did 50% of all California driver's licenses go to illegal aliens, but they have motor voter laws so those illegals are now eligible to vote even though they are not citizens. Non-citizen should NEVER be allowed to vote and neither should welfare recipients who have been on welfare for more than two years. They should not be allowed to vote on how the money from tax payers is spent when they are not paying taxes themselves.","post_message":"Did you know HALF of all California driverâ€™s licenses issued in 2015 went to illegal aliens?"},{"comment_id":"10154874909449369","commenter_b":"No actually one of my best friends is a gay black woman.
