It is not the job of Ginsburg to comment on any of the political constituents, democrat or republican. Her job is to interpret the law only and she is way out of bounds in this matter. If she wants to leave the country somebody would have to nudge her and wake her up because every time she is seen on tv she is either falling asleep or looking like she just woke up. It is way past the time for her to retire.","commenter_a":"This old prune needs to retire. She can't even stay awake.

Ever wondered why Christians and Moslems, both claiming to own the truth, have no qualms about trying to force others to believe as they do? Holiness is not spread by force, and people that attempt to do so are not holy. Jesus was not a prophet. He was a religious Jew and political activist who was against Roman rule and the political establishment that existed in Judea. Years later his followers rewrote history and invented a religion. Christianity is not divine and it is therefore falsehood. Mohammed was not a prophet. He attempted to gain a following among the Jews, but when he failed he became violent. Mohammed, like his followers, was a murderer, a thief and apparently psycholigically impaired. Islam is not divine ...","post_message":"ISLAMO-REALISM: ISIS Defends Burning Jordanian Pilot: Mohammed Burned People Alive, We  The Footsteps Of Allah Messenger  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"817721241706741","commenter_b":"She hasn't even a woman very long.....","commenter_a":"I'm very happy that you are living the life you want to live, Caitlyn- but that by no means makes you an expert on all women or what is good for them.","post_message":"It takes a lot of nerve for a Ted Cruz supporter to say something like this..."}]
