They are crooks","commenter_a":"If Sanders were to be nominated and elected in Nov, big problem is that he has not raised money, or campaigned for, congressional Democratic candidates. In other words, Sanders will be no better off than Obama has been if he can't get enough members of Congress to pass his initiatives.","post_message":"The attacks are going to get more unhinged."},{"comment_id":"1065479603531539","commenter_b":"Only more proof that you can't fix stupid!

And when government doesn't know who has it. There's a reason America in a last century (and before) was the safest place to live in the world. Totaling all the murders in 20th century USA is 10-20 times safer than S. America, Africa, Europe or Asia. Thanks to 2nd Amendment in our Constitution.","commenter_a":"It is odd how right-wing custodians of patriotism have a problem with Kapernick regarding the anthem but hardly emit a peep when scores of people are killed by lunatics with guns who take advantage of that great piece of antediluvian legislation otherwise known as the Second Amendment.","post_message":"\"Declining to stand and laud that country until these outrageous, deadly imbalances are repaired – until our flag actually does represent everyone – is perfectly reasonable.

She's not getting the award for getting surgery, she's getting the award for standing up in a bigoted, judgmental, harsh world and being her authentic self. She is giving hope and courage to thousands of transgender people all over the world and showing them it's OK to be themselves. Who knows how many people she is saving from suicide by being strong enough to go public and be treated with ridicule, ignorance, and hate. She's making a tremendous impact on the LGBTQA community. Courage comes in all forms. Are only the military and first responders allowed to show courage? Is that the only type of courage we're allowed to recognize? I choose to disagree. Of course Noah is courageous, no one is saying he isn't.
