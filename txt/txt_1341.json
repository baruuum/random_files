First, the pictures weren't taken outside of the US, they were taken here. So the argument that they 'could have been taken outside of the country' doesn't hold weight. Second, yes, models come here and do photoshoots 'all the time', however, as the article states, there is a way to do it legally, and a way to do it illegally/fraudulently. From her own statements, it seems there might be a case where it was done wrong. And lastly, it does matter because Trump's platform is 'do it the right way, she did it the right way', and if she didn't do it the right way, then it is yet another lie and makes them hypocrites. I realize she isn't running, but he is so he made this an issue. If this were the Michelle ...","post_message":"Melania Trump has said she first came to the United States in 1996 on a short-term visa, which wouldn't have allowed her to work as a model.

We are female, wear thongs and stiletto heels so obviously that translates to 'I want sex and will have it with anybody and my screams of no & stop obviously mean, yes!' And if you go to court they ask questions about your underwear and what we're you doing out. Never ask the rapist what he was wearing or why he thought you walking down a street by yourself translates to brutally attack and rape me. It's 2015 the world has come far but on certain things importance ranks zero.","commenter_a":"road","post_message":"'I witnessed this years ago, after I was raped myself'"}]
