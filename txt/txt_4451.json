He says he does not hate the flag. Does not hate America. He doesn't sound \"spoiled\" to me (and I am an affluent, old, white guy). He has used his position to stimulate conversation about a very important issue. (Why IS it that a lot of black people out for a walk end up getting shot without many repercussions?)
