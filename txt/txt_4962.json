Businesses used to post signs such as \"Help Wanted--Irish Need Not Apply\" or of course Jim Crow laws. Would you seriously be okay with the return of Jim Crow? Businesses have discriminated in horribly blatant ways. Up until just a few years ago women weren't allowed to be members of all sorts of organizations even though there was nothing about the organization that was impossible for women (they were mostly golf and country clubs). We've had 50 years of the Civil Rights Act which people seem happy to toss out the window. If that were to happen, you yourself could easily be discriminated against with no recourse. Please read some civil rights history and see what incredibly horrible things were said and done to decent, hard-working ...","commenter_a":"I thought a private business owner reserved the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. We have a sign up at work that says exactly that. I may think his is a dumb reason (even though to him it is not), but he is a private business owner operating on private property and should have the right to do business with whomever he wishes, and not do business with whomever he doesn't wish to do business with. That being said, I wonder what he'd say if he tried to go into a diner for lunch and saw a sign that said \"No Christians allowed.\"","post_message":"A Florida gun supply owner says his store is now a “Muslim-free zone” -- after the deadly shooting in Tennessee.

Should never have a show on the air that advocates bigotry and hatred while showing women as animals for breeding purposes that are be owned. Also the show advocates for having more children than you can afford (unless you have a reality show to pay the bills) and more kids than you can physically and emotionally take care of.","post_message":"Do you think TLC should cancel 19 Kids and Counting?"},{"comment_id":"10154078689087894","commenter_b":"Smh! I find it hard for woman to think they can touch people and think its ok. Everybody don't like to be touched.

Sit back and enjoy the show....without touching me!","commenter_a":"Oh please he didn't take his foot and shoved it down her throat! He tapped that girl with the top of his shoe.
