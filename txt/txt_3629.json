But in the final analysis you can not find any harm caused by that. In the mean time just consider the damage caused to our nation by the rigidity caused by the Republican Congress over the past eight years. Your solution is to nominate a man devoid of any moral compass. Thanks Republicans. I can only hope that what rises from the ashes of the Grand Old Party will come closer to Abe's vision and that Rush L. stays buried in the ashes.","commenter_a":"I just do not understand how any true red blooded America could even think about voting for Hillary after her cover up of Benghazi and Emails !!

I'm African American, I shop high end... I've definitely experienced Racism while shopping, but I could literally count the incidents. Racism is very real, but it's being used and over used to justify everything! However, if this is true, why did he wait until he was fired to speak up.
