Disney World was actually built around swamps. Yes they altered the swamps and created the lagoon but it has always had alligators in it. Sorry a toddler died because of the lack of understanding of that fact.","commenter_a":"Give me a break. My 7 year old heard about this and the first thing she said is \"why would they go near the water? It's Florida! Everyone knows there are alligators in Florida!\". We are from Wisconsin.","post_message":"A case against Walt Disney World would hinge on whether or not the resort knew about the alligators living in the resort's Seven Seas Lagoon."},{"comment_id":"10153438703061130","commenter_b":"A FEMINIST is for EVERYONE.","commenter_a":"this woman is a complete poser. she does not stand with all women. just ask conservative women orgs","post_message":"\"Saying something is almost always better than swallowing it and then thinking about it for two days.\""},{"comment_id":"10153184116079330","commenter_b":"She is just the white female version of what we already have.

I've worked with a woman in construction 25 years ago in construction. I quit that job, and got an easier one. She remained, lol. I don't mind Feminism, I think it's something that needs to exist. I just don't like the internet clusters of nutjobs, who believe if you smile or say \"hello\" to a woman, you are promoting rape culture-whatever the fuck that is. These types of Feminists are useless. They need to fuck off.","commenter_a":"According to 2010 BLS data, the following jobs contain 1 percent female workers or less: boiler making, brick masonry, stonemasonry, septic tank servicing, sewer pipe cleaning and working with reinforcing iron and rebar. Maybe the reason female workers aren't in these occupations is that too many are in other occupations. Females are 97 percent of preschool and kindergarten teachers, 80 percent of social workers, 82 percent of librarians and 92 percent of dietitians and nutritionists and registered nurses. Women have demanded more professorships, seats in congress and chairs in the boardroom, but have never complained that there were not enough female garbage collectors, waste water treatment workers, plumbers, welders, pipe fitters, coal miners, truck drivers, brick masons an block masons, lumberjacks, oil rig workers, well drillers, surveyors, longshoremen, construction workers, landscapers, sheet metal workers, HVAC repair persons, meat packers, high rise window washers, car mechanics, iron workers or any physically ...","post_message":"\"Philip Zimbardo is one of the first people undergraduate psychologists learn about. His prison experiment in the basement of Stanford University showed a darker side of humanity. He now tells us that there are fewer men than women at college, stating that positive discrimination is now needed to increase the numbers of men at university, but this is because ‘one reason you go to college is to find a guy’. Not only are these kinds of views horribly sexist and outdated, they’re also far too simplistic.\""},{"comment_id":"10154185145943132","commenter_b":"Sue happy! These ladies are cracking me up.
