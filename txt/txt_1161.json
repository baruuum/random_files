How ever if you think that man will ever do anything, that would make America stronger then you greatly disappoint my opinion of you.","post_message":"While the President closed his State of the Union address by noting his desire to work across the aisle, much of his speech was spent digging in his heels on the same tax-and-spend policies rejected by the American people rather than identifying areas of common ground. But while I’m generally disappointed he took this tack, I still think there were some hints of bipartisanship that might present opportunities to grow a stronger economy. For starters, I agree with the President that Congress must pass a trade promotion authority bill. With two of the largest free trade agreements in the history of the world currently being negotiated, it is vital that the administration works with Congress to set negotiating priorities so that a deal might be completed quickly. In order to grow our economy, we must continue to open foreign markets to agricultural products and manufactured goods from places like Indiana, ..."},{"comment_id":"897936806940850","commenter_b":"DUMBASSES!!!!!!!!!","commenter_a":"People take note of these 18 cities and steer clear.","post_message":"ALERT: These 18 U.S. Cities Just Made Terrifying Announcement About Muslim ‘Refugees’… Do YOU Live There? @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154405827009170","commenter_b":"Two evil sisters!","commenter_a":"Goofy the fake indian with Chief \"Lie to your face\" Clinton!","post_message":"Lord help us if we have to listen to these two for the next 4-8 years..."},{"comment_id":"10153996390124071","commenter_b":"@username STOP ALL WELFARE PROGRAMS AND WE WILL NOT BE FINE! THERE WILL BE MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, MORE DRUG ISSUES, MORE CRIME, MORE HOMELESSNESS, MORE TRAUMA.. THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER BUT IF THERE WAS A LIVING WAGE PUT IN PLACE WE WOULD HAVE LESS PEOPLE ON WELFARE THAT IS A GIVEN. TOO EASY..","commenter_a":"Velocity of Money: I think it's quite simple if you look at something called velocity of money. What does that mean? That is the money that gets spent back into the economy. When you have the top 1% getting money, they spend 5-10% of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend 100-110% of what they earn. Since we are a consumer economy this will be good for business in the long term. Not for the people getting the $15 per hour.","post_message":"An economist explains why Clinton’s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 might be 'too much, too quickly.'"},{"comment_id":"1232367160117626","commenter_b":"You aren't a fan of any carnivorous animal?

I don't think the joke was just in good humor. There's enough language here to clearly see that he was being hateful towards the LGBT community. After all, he did say the word \"lesbian\".
