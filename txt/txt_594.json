They have nothing to offer our citizens but hatred & fraud. Neither Russia nor China could have planned it better. These evil people have taken a strong, compassionate country & turned into the laughing stock of the rest of the free world. All they really want is to have us pay for & die for their desire to make war all the time. It's time we figured out that these \"straight\" (maybe) white men are truly impotent & can only declare their\"manliness\" by making war on everyone rlse, including you & I. If there is such a thing as the \"anti-Christ\", it has come in the form of the Teapublicans, not just one person. They are sickening & digusting.","post_message":"Too true.
