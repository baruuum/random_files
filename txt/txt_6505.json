You lost because of all the horrible things you did. Trump might have said a couple bad things, but you did many bad things. You spend our enemies money bashing him and he funded himself.

That is not a coincidence at all. We taxpayers, the People, are paying for the subjugation and torment of a large portion of our population. Mostly a minority inmate population, I might add. It's just wrong no matter how you look at it.","post_message":"The U.S. has more people in jail than any other country on earth.
