You think most young mothers WANT to live on assistance you're a bigger Tard than you sound! The only way this maybe possibly would fly is if you held the FATHERS accountable too!!!! Duh.....sorry it's obvious you barely made it through ninth grade TROLLER","commenter_a":"I've been saying this for years, they say our roads suck well get the freeloaders on welfare to go fix them, instead of chain gangs picking up trash make them do it. It's no ones fault but your own if you want kids, make sure you can support them! Welfare should be a times thing like a year after that your done. If you think flipping burgers is beneath you guess what if it means you have food, shelter and clothes it beats nothing at all if you have to work two jobs that's on you, maybe you should have made something of yourself! No more giving illegal aliens good stamps or any kind of government handout. You want to be an American go get a job and pay taxes like everyone else!","post_message":"Take note.....it's damn brilliant."},{"comment_id":"982881765080578","commenter_b":"I hope so how can that woman even sleep much less lead a country would she do that to all Americans how can anybody vote for her","commenter_a":"I look at this picture and am reminded of the horrible torture this man endured, before his death, and wonder what really happened and who was responsible for not seeing the embassy was secured for their safety.
