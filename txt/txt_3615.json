He also attacked the cops, that is clearly seen on video. White people who are drunk and high on drugs are beaten by the police when they resist arrest too... Please tell all the story of you are going to tell it. As for the Black Lives Matter movement goes, they just increase tension and stir things up. All Lives Matter, end of story. Where are the BLM protesters when two black kids are shot in their front yard in a gang-related shooting and there are no leads in the case? Nowhere. If a white police officer isn't involved, they don't care. They just want headlines, not community building. And that community is all of us, not just one ethnic group.","post_message":"Rodney King, an American taxi driver, was beaten by four LAPD officers after being caught speeding. He suffered a fractured facial bone, a broken right ankle and severe bruising and lacerations. It sparked a global conversation about police brutality; two of the officers were found guilty of violating King’s civil rights on April 16th 1993"},{"comment_id":"10154305617489205","commenter_b":"Filthy slut!","commenter_a":"The world ends tomorrow","post_message":"Donald Trump Appears At Pre-Inauguration Lincoln Memorial Concert"},{"comment_id":"10154228766276523","commenter_b":"All over being asked about a reusable bag?!

No one has to live under Sharia law unless they desire to participate. Women that are abused need to run to a shelter with their children ASAP.","commenter_a":"Brilliant and brave that Ben Carson would say openly what a majority of Americans are to afraid to say about Islam. Obvious to non-politicians what the incompatibility is all about.","post_message":"Carson is the first presidential candidate ever – or perhaps since Thomas Jefferson – to show a detailed knowledge of Islam and Sharia: “Right now,” he said about the possibility of a Muslim President, “when you have something that is against the rights of women, against the rights of gays, subjugates other religions and a host of things that are not compatible with our Constitution, why in fact would you take that chance?” Brilliant. Contrast those clear and simple and accurate words to the Obama administration’s systematic and deliberate denial of the nature and reality of the jihad threat. The entire Obama response to the jihad is called “Countering Violent Extremism.” Note the glaring absence of any reference to Islam and jihad. Obama is trying to fight a war while pretending that the enemy is other than what he is, or even worse, is nameless, faceless, and bereft of ideology. ..."},{"comment_id":"547567615431531","commenter_b":"And these stupid women continue to bash America when they could be free from the tyranny they have lived with for generations!","commenter_a":"This is not an act of religion, it is an individual's act.
