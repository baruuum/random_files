You don't want to do any of the heavy lifting. There's no reciprocation on the part of feminists because they only care about themselves. Even if I did respond how you wanted, you wouldn't address any of my points and simply make ad hominem attacks. That's all you people are capable of because you have no critical thinking skills.","commenter_a":"To the men commenting on this post that are shaming other men for being feminists: shame on you. You are just proving the very reason why we, as males, have much to benefit from feminism as well","post_message":"The male activists all face roadblocks. Other men might think it's strange for guys to talk about sexual health in public. Women sometimes resent the idea of men offering them information about their bodies."}]
