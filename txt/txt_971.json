The USA is goin to shit","commenter_a":"Most of the people commenting here have no concept of freedom. The beauty of America is if you don't like the way one busines does thongs, you can go to another. Using government to force people to comply is not Freedom. Should a gay baker be forced to make a cake for an anti gay group? This is a continuing attack on the rights of American's in general, just like telling businesses the can't smoke in them anymore. Just because a business is open to the public does not mean every person has a right to frequent there no matter what.","post_message":"How do YOU feel about this case? Should government be able to force businesses to do things against their will by writing legislation? What do YOU think?"},{"comment_id":"10154732148698961","commenter_b":"You recently proclaimed that you would rather see a move toward screening and the passage of more gun control. Are you serious? American citizens are being raped and murdered by illegal aliens streaming into our borders and you want them all to come on in, collect benefits paid for by American taxpayers, yet take away guns that can protect us from these illegals. You are a very disturbed person and even worse are those endorsing you and voting for you. It's a state turned upside down by liberal sycophants.","commenter_a":"Senator Murphy, how about a little get together down here in the New Haven area?","post_message":"A huge THANK YOU to everyone who came to the town hall tonight.
