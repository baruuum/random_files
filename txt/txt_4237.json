There are a lot of black people who refuse to acknowledge we're no longer in 1955 and their shortcomings are primarily their own (the Obamas are not in that camp, by the way); and there are a lot of white people in stark denial of our nation's less than glorious past. And do people even read articles before they post their drivel? The First Lady was praising America for our progress, not looking down on the nation. Get a grip, people.","post_message":"Michelle Obama gave her last commencement speech as first lady at the City College of New York."}]
