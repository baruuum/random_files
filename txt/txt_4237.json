You get no say. Your ignorance proves you shouldn't have any. You think no women in your country get abortions? No, they get unsafe back-alley or home abortions. Men should absolutely not get to make legal decisions over what occurs within a woman's body.","commenter_a":"Your body is your choice only when your body will have 2 heads 4 arms 4 legs..if you want a choice you should buy a pack of condoms or close the oval tubes..stop abortion in Gods name.","post_message":"In Mike Pence's name"},{"comment_id":"1091280717559605","commenter_b":"@username, are you really that concerned this man will not reach his full potential of sexual pleasure!? He's a man for christ sake! The last thing he needs is anymore reason.. I don't miss the excess skin they removed from vag after giving birth.

America could be more friendly.","post_message":"An editor for The New York Times wrote an open letter to a woman who told him to \"go back to China.\" Asian-Americans responded by sharing their own racist moments using #thisis2016.
