Mumford & Sons had nothing to do with THE CITIES/RESIDENTS. You can't blame a band for the amount of fans they attract, they're grammy award winning musciams coming of a 2 year hiatus after releasng a long awaited album. The city is the problem here for using this \"cleanout method\" which they are literally treating these people, HUMAN BEINGS, like trash and obviously have no problem using terms that state that. Blame the city not the band, oh and actually read the article.","post_message":"Not cool."},{"comment_id":"1024542317579852","commenter_b":"@username, Planned Parenthood doesn't sell body parts and those that say they do are lying","commenter_a":"Thanks to the fact that the local Planned Parenthood clinic was closed down in Scottsburg, testing for AIDS and other diseases was nearly nonexistent in Scott County. And now Republicans are wanting to defund Planned Parenthood despite the fact that abortions make up only 3% of what PP does. SMH... @webpagelink","post_message":"In recent weeks, the American people have learned more about the barbaric practices Planned Parenthood uses to take innocent human life. Despite the outrage of millions of Americans, Planned Parenthood’s response has been to blame the messenger or the videographer, without addressing the barbaric practice of harvesting aborted body parts.  We need to let Planned Parenthood know that the American people do not support these inhumane practices. Congress should vote to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood before we leave for August recess. I urge Senate leadership to give every Senator the opportunity to affirm that life is a sacred and precious gift that must be protected."},{"comment_id":"10153762499342483","commenter_b":"@username but she taking millions of dollars from terrorist country and support Obama funding Iran and terrorist","commenter_a":"Why would anyone vote for lying Hillary","post_message":"Forecasters give Hillary Clinton a big chance to win, noting that the odds of her losing the race are about the same as an NFL kicker missing a field goal from the 20-yard line."},{"comment_id":"1050080195049016","commenter_b":"another dumb btch","commenter_a":"So Donald Trump you are not the savior we need for this country, I do not think you will bring jobs or prosperity when you do not even pay great wages for people that work for you.
