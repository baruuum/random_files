The difference between Russia and the USA is that the USA never asked for permission to invade any country. They just did what they wanted, and they destroyed the whole country with it's sovereignty. Another difference is - when you sea how these leaders greet \"dictators\" as they call them, with extremely wide hypocritical smile, and after a while the destroy them. Russian leader doesn't smile that much, but you get the feeling that he doesn't substitute his values and he is a person that can be trusted.","commenter_a":"Closed CAPTIONS, please!","post_message":"Five of CNN's correspondents look back at the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin this year, and what impact there may be in the future. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153948150211680","commenter_b":"Someone has butt hurt, I'll keep licking my windows while you keep hoping for your 72 virgins.","commenter_a":"Is Trump seriously just now realizing his supporters are a bunch of window-licking water heads?
