If Defunded..the government funding would simply be re-allocating taxpayer dollars to approximately 13,500 Women's Health centers across the country, (ones who actually own a mammogram machine & provide prenatal care, & ambulatory care--which PP does not do at all.) Planned Parenthood is breaking the law: delivering 2nd term babies to cut the organs out for resale & killing them outside the womb.

Plus PP helps Human Traffickers & pays cover up millions for mothers deaths on the abortion table. Women deserve better.
