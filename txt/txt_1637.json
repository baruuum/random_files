This is a grave mistake. Once again, the President's administration demonstrates their inability to lead as Commander-in-Chief. Because he does not have an effective strategy for defeating ISIL/ISIS, he is putting troops on the ground without the protection of our air forces and asking the Russians, politely, to not bomb them. For over 50 years, our air forces have ensured no member of the American military has been killed by an enemy airstrike. I hope the Administrationâ€™s poor decision-making does not change this fact.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"453039741550986","commenter_b":"Pretty and can shoot too !","commenter_a":"This maybe my new favorite person,what a gal!!!!
