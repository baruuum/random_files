Illegals are not immigrants, immigrants are people that came to the United States legally. American taxpayers should not have to pay for illegal activity, or anyone that came here illegally. I believe that all illegals need to go back to where they came from and return legally. If a child was born here from an illegal alien they need to go home with their parents, come back legally, they were born here illegally does not make them an American. All illegals should be thanking us for allowing them to stay for long, time for them to take what they have learned here in America and help the people in their homeland/country.

Maybe a younger person follows what is 'the done thing' but with age and life experience, I think women just do what they want!","commenter_a":"It's just like the shaved pubes issue - all the same arguments. 'I do it for myself' etc etc. Look, virtually no young women shaved their pubes before porn videos made men expect it. And virtually no older women dyed their hair before looking our age became unacceptable. I've had enough of all this 'I do it for me' nonsense - look a bit deeper for god's sake and let's be a bit more honest about our motives and the forces that drive us.","post_message":"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been groomed ‚Äì by the media, by advertisers, and now by ourselves ‚Äì to understand that our gender has to try harder, to consume more, when it comes to our appearance.

As long as the extremists face no serious consequences, they will just get more and more radical in their pronouncements and actions. Only when there is a very strong backlash is there any chance of them backing down, as we saw when the anti-communist witch hunts were finally contained. But religious extremism like Huckabee's is much harder to deal with (as Goldwater presciently saw), because they regard all resistance as persecution and attacks by spiritual enemies. Sadly there is a chance, even if it is small at the moment, that America will ride the tiger of extremism to disaster. And unlike Germany after WW2, there would be unlikely to be any second chances, any opportunity for redemption, because a radical, apocalyptic, theocratic USA would almost certainly initiate WW3.","post_message":"Mike Huckabee thinks that as president, he could prevent literally all abortion."},{"comment_id":"1609193876054360","commenter_b":"Karma has a lot of work ahead of her!","commenter_a":"Shame on all that participated!
