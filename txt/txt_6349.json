There is already a fence up and they scale it. If you build a bigger wall then they will just dig tunnels.","commenter_a":"Governor, I've always respected you. I voted for you when you ran for president eight years ago, and I was proud to cast that vote. That said, wouldn't it be better to have him arrested and locked away where he can't do any more harm, regardless of what side of the border he's on? I'm concerned that having a \"deport the criminals\" stance fuels a xenophobic mentality that all illegal immigrants are dangerous criminals. Also, there's no way to ensure he stays deported for good, even with a wall. Lastly, it seems to imply that if he's a danger to society that we don't care about the lives of people outside of our borders. Aren't humans worthy of human dignity regardless of what side of the border they're on? Imprisonment seems like the best option. I'm genuinely curious, and would appreciate an honest, civil discussion.","post_message":"Prayers today for the family of North Texas firefighter Captain Peter Hacking, who was killed along with his four-year-old stepdaughter and 22-month-old son when a van veered into their lane and hit their car head-on. If the van driver recovers, he’ll be charged with criminally negligent homicide. Let’s hope that’s also enough to get him deported for good, since he’s an illegal immigrant who was already deported in 2008, but came right back across the border. Normally, I’d link to a news site for more, but I’d rather that you read it here. It’s the GoFundMe page set up to help Captain Hacking’s widow and his surviving son and four step-children:"},{"comment_id":"10155525671531002","commenter_b":"@username It is my business when it is my tax dollars going to feed you .","commenter_a":"If you can eat it and drink it why is it anyone's business what you buy.

Anyone dumb enough to support him might as well give your vote to Hillary because that is what you asshats are doing NOTHING in Trump's history suggests he is a real conservative.
