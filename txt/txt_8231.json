Shall we remember our horrible history? Shall we remember how Caucasians forced their way through other's land? Shall we remember the genocide that occurred? Shall we remember public lynches? Shall we remember the Trail Of Tears? Shall I go on?..... Who are the TRUE criminals here? Caucasian ancestors FORCED their way through due to greed. Most other immigrants come to America to WORK to provide for their family. So I repeat, UNLESS you're Native American, you come from immigrants as well, possibly even illegal. You're ancestors (Caucasian), if they've been here since the 1700s or 1800s, could have been the murderers, thieves, and rapist roaming around tormenting innocent. An add-in...who will do super low-pay labor? Mexicans are hardworkers, even when we are living in severe poverty, we still try to WORK.

I'm still waiting on them to post the story about the white guy in South Dakota, that accidently shot his penis, while purchasing a gun illegally and tried to blame it on a black guy. They didn't even post the story about the white people in TX, that vandalized their vehicles and tried to put the blame on BLM.
