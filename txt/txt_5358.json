If a kid can't wear a t-shirt with our STARS & STRIPES, for example, then this person should not be allowed in the girls restroom and locker room. Period. There is no reason an alternative restroom shouldn't suffice.","post_message":"These students just sent a BOLD message to this school after a transgender classmate said he should be allowed to use the girls bathrooms and locker room.

Now Sen. McConnell, by invoking Rule 19 may well have prevented the inclusion of this letter in the official record once again, in spite of the continued publicity it has received during the hearing. Our History is thus written by the \"Vicors\". Maybe it is still possible to insert that letter into the official Record of the Debates.","post_message":"I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight. Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully and fairly enforce the law. Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have. There‚Äôs no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly and clearly: This is just the beginning. If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while Donald Trump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us. If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism, and bigotry into the Justice Department, he'll hear from all of us. And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions‚Äôs radical hatred into the Justice Department ..."}]
