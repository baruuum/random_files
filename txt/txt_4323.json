After Bummercare, we were told that 40 million Americans were still uninsured. One year later, we were told that 55 million Americans were either uninsured for under insured. Islamic religion prohibits insurance because they claim it's gambling and are exempt from getting insurance. With the current influx of refugees and people sneaking into our country and getting free medical, welfare and food stamps, how many millions are now in this country unisured or under insured? Why would anyone bother to get insurance? Hospitals still take patients, doctors still see patients, and medicine is still sold at the pharmacies. If no one has insurance, costs will immediately be adjusted and negotiated at a lower cost. People will stop running to a doctor for every sniffle.","commenter_a":"amazed it lasted as long as it did, now the states are left holding the bag right along with those folks who tried to abide by that totally damaging obummercareless law.","post_message":"Oh Not Again! 400,000 Americans Enrolled In Obamacare Need To Find A New Plan"},{"comment_id":"10153536003698967","commenter_b":"God...
