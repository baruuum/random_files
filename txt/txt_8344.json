George W Bush came along and reaped havoc on every financial sector, leaving millions losing their homes, Savings depleted and left America in the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Barack Obama won the Presidency and without any help from obstructionist Republicans, Obama saved America from another Depression and stabilized America's financial sectors.
