Most illegals work in Agriculture, and farmers said they don't want them removed. I don't think illegals are our problem. They pay billions each year in taxes. For example, food, sales, telecommunications, cable, transtportation, gas, etc. If we got rid of them, we would lose in the end no matter how many jobs we would get in industries that don't require I-9s.","commenter_a":"It's sad, heartbreaking, and demoralizing to people on that side of town that have tried to do anything to help curb the problems. The answer is not to make the situation worse by closing the store. The store is the lone grocery story on that side of town @username. That is not going to help. The solution is to deal with the poverty on that side of town. People steal and rob and sell drugs for economic reasons. They are broke basically. That's why on the Westside the BP got robbed by the White lady. She was broke, and she committed an armed robbery because she got desperate and didn't know what else to do. It's the same thing that has been happening on the Eastside, it's just spreading across the city. We have to build up both sides.

Politicians need to smile for likability. Likability is crucial in a candidate. It's why a sweating Nixon went down to JFK. It's why the trope of \"kissing babies\" became a thing for politicians of any level. When I think of male pols who didn't smile, they didn't do so hot. Your Bob Doles, your Ralph Naders, your Jim Webbs. All pols need to be likable, and I can remember accounts of the \"dourness\" of the above males mentioned in the news, but when it's mentioned about a woman, it's not okay? She's running for President, this is fair commentary.","post_message":"Were other (male) candidates called out the same way?"},{"comment_id":"1341790949180015","commenter_b":"There are people in the world that defend raping children and killing babies .
