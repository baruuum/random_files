Just ask the Native Americans, the Aboriginies of Australia, and the countless number of African countries that still suffer from the effects of all the death and destruction caused by what the devils call imperialism and colonization. The devil who comes disguised as white people is absolutely disagreeable to live with in peace. It's been proven time and time again.","commenter_a":"Didn't take long for the racial comments on a post that has nothing to do with race.

It's about getting control of a situation that's currently OUT of control. If we don't move forward with the current plan, than what? Yes folks we are not in the same situation, but a much worse one. SIMPLE! Think about it, they are already currently living here and paying NO taxes. Unless we can beam these people up bye my calculations, YEP, there still here. Let's look back at what was actually said, the President NEVER said he was going to legalize any body's current status, just give them a chance to apply while working on there current status.
