(Combat arms) Pretending to be a man would get them in. Unable to meet standards, they would damage our combat effectiveness, ability to adapt, and endanger the mission. That, and people will get killed dragging them along instead of fighting the enemy. IF it is tolerated too long, they will wind up deployed in a combat situation. It will cost lives. Caught unable to meet standards in the rear will cost them a possible career, and they will be processed out. Nothing wrong with that to you?","commenter_a":"Being transgender is not a mental disorder. Both the APA and the AMA agree. Also nearly every single western military in the world allows transgender people to serve openly in the military. Even Israel, a country that has significant treats to their nation allows transgender people to serve openly. Plus there are already 15,000 transgender people serving in the US military right now. Their service should be honored and not conditioned upon whether or not they can keep their gender identity a secret.","post_message":"\"He began to suspect that the military, despite its ban on allowing transgender people to serve, was somehow attracting them at a disproportionately high rate.\""},{"comment_id":"10153847356156162","commenter_b":"It's sexual assault by two nasty woman....!!","commenter_a":"Working for tips...","post_message":"WANTED FOR TWERKING: Two women are being sought for sexual assault after twerking on an innocent man.
