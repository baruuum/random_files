Well when the carnage starts in Colorado, we will see just how humane the move was. Every citizen of this country that has a gun needs to lock and load because what happened in Paris is coming here! If you can't see the truth then you are just as blind and ignorant as our so called leaders!

There is NO basis to convict her of any wrong doing. The Republicans have lied about her for years and I'm sure they will continue. In the meantime I won't vote for anyone as repulsive as Donald Trump. He will, in my opinion, destroy this Country and our reputation around the World.","post_message":"How does this make ANY sense? From CNN: \"Donald Trump may say he's concerned about the little guy, but his tax plan would give the wealthy far bigger breaks than the middle class or working Americans. The Top 1% would see a whopping $275,250 reduction in their federal tax bill, or 17.5% of their after-tax income.\""}]
