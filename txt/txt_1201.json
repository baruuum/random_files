There is no way you should be neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. But you're playing weak. Go on the attack. Use your willingness to stay in a marriage regardless of your husband's infidelity as a selling point. We all know people make mistakes. Marriages often dissolve over a hint of unfaithfulness and unforgiveness. Only the extremely strong can take a mistake made by a spouse to demonstrate their character. If I'm not mistaken this is Sanders' second wife and 'The Donald' has had three wives and several affairs. How many times have you been married? They can't use President Bill Clinton's infidelity to their advantage, but you can. Who are the people advising you?","post_message":"Jimmy Fallon: Can we do a Snapchat?

Are you serious right now? Hillary has been exposed for who she is and it's not looking good for her. For she is so squeaky clean, why does she keep hiding from the media? She is always at home resting. She used her position to grant favors to foreign governments and took millions from them when they abuse women. You are worried about Trump being exposed on that debate stage? What a joke!","commenter_a":"The snake oil salesman's chickens come home to roost Monday night.
