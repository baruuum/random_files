He has no answers for you that are going to give you hope. He'd probably tell the children that they need to be vetted first to see if they love American values, even though they're only children.","post_message":"Ahead of tonight's debate, the children of Aleppo ask Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

It's way too late - you GOP establishment idiots are the ones who are making it possible for the democrats to get 4 more years to continue to destroy this country! Just because Mr Trump doesn't lean to the 'far' right, doesn't mean he's not a Republican! I don't lean to the 'far' right, but I am a Republican! It's time for some real middle of the road compromising - more real and true policies will get passed and the stagnant economy, security, and the best welfare of Americans will come to fruition! Won't buy national review ever again - especially since they have nuts like beck involved!","post_message":"As it's starting to look more like Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee, some in the conservative movement are viciously attacking the NYC businessman.

I choose CRUZ!","post_message":"Is there a real connection between hand size and penis size? We decided to investigate what the science says on the matter..."}]
