He has zero respect for our military and would be very happy if all military members that don't support his new direction for this country would resign. We have a President that wants to convert America into a third world country that will allow him to remain its Dictator. Everyone needs to remember the USSR and how it broke up into many small countries that are loaded with the rich leadership and the overtaxed people who just want to live in peace. Russia's streets are ruled by gangs and the mafia. WAKE UP AMERICA!!!","commenter_a":"Obama is some commander in chief NOT!! He should be ashamed!
