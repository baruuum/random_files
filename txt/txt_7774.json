KILLARY sold out America to the highest bidders..several Muslim countries, big businesses, private persons gave millions to the made-up Clinton \"Foundation\". The Clintons PRIVATE SLUSH FUND. Only 10% is donated. KILLARY then sold 20% of America's uranium to Russia. OBUMMER Paid 400 Million to Iran in foreign currency , cash. That's not mentioning all the lies that has been told to the AMERICAN PEOPLE. The Democratic Party is now just socialists, communists. All of you need to see Clinton Cash.

A change is coming in American politics, and even Hillary Clinton won't be able to stop it. Delay it, maybe, but the majority of the American people from all sides have had enough with business as usual at their expense and are mad as hell about it. Just look at the long lines at the polls and the huge turnouts at Bernie Sanders' rallies if there are any doubts - that is the beginning of the revolution which Sanders is talking about.","post_message":"Left enough already?"}]
