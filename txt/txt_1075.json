And any illegal citizens can be clear by any countrys government, Bangladesh will do that and India also can clear any illegal citizens from their country.","commenter_a":"He is a Novel laureate for peace from Bangladesh but he didn't said anything about Myanmar Muslim crisis!! Bangladesh facing huge problem for the crisis but as a novel laureate he has some responsibilities to stop violence in Myanmar but he acting like a blind coward and always making way to steal money from poor peoples.

Donald Trump- another great White Hope! Trump joins a long list of rich entitled white boys who, were it not for their daddies, handing them everything on a silver platter, would have probably ended up on public assistance. Trump represents everything that is wrong with America. He is a gaudy bully and fake gold plated braggart who has showcased his business and moral acumen through a unending series of bankruptcies and divorces. He is a racist grifter and a criminal environmental rapist. In terms of patriotism and service to country, Bush, Romney, Cheney, Trump did not serve this country that they profess to love. But none of these fake ass patriots apparently have any qualms about sending other American children into harms way. For this crowd of 'real Americans' it's all about the Benjamins and what's in it for me.

African countries sell these permits for more than the price of the average house in the USA, and only allow hunters to take the old males that have already reproduced.

That's not what this country is supposed to be about. We are strongest when we stand together."}]
