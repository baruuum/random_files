DFACS clearly states in their policy that she is okay to work for them! There's no need to put this woman on blast like that. Making some mistakes doesn't make her incapable of helping children in need. It's unfortunate people are being so judgemental. I'm glad DFACS is protecting her in the workplace.","post_message":"HOLDING THE POWERFUL ACCOUNTABLE: A state investigator responsible for ensuring the safety of Georgia's children can be convicted of forgery and pulling a gun in a road rage incident and apparently still keep her job.

I can't believe how many Americans are so brainwashed against a little socialism. You guys at \"the top\" gotta get back to basics. The greed in your country is appalling. We are the lucky ones to still have subsidized healthcare. Taxes should go first to education and not onky spelling and writing, but to teaching life-skills, budgeting, health. 2nd to health including dental health. Tax the crap out of the fat and sugar laden processed foods. Start caring for community and stop supporting the conglomerates. Yay for Obama. The best president since JFK, only mote moral in his private life.","post_message":"BREAKING: President Obama to call for 2 years of free community college for all students.
