So Obama has almost rescued us from the disaster the Republicans left us when Bush was in office.

History is repeating itself and no one is taking notice. The Middle East is on fire. Obama and Hillary started this with Libya, they had no business getting involved. Now we have a flood of Muslims who hate American and our culture. They do not want to be equal, they want to dominate and change America and the West to a Muslim country.

It's a genocide but Obama only brings in Muslims no Christians. Americans are being told, to take down crosses, take pork from American public schools, allow Muslims to have pray time in public schools, Our children are learning Islam is the faith to be.

They'll have a small country entering the EU (mostly unscreened). Europes economy is already weak. Germany has a strong economy, but they're carrying the bulk of the weight.
