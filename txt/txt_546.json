Hillary Clinton would never be allowed to be an angry, cantankerous revolutionary with wild hair like Bernie....she would not make it in American politics. Women have to play a completely different game...and look good doing it or they are toast!","commenter_a":"Perhaps true criticisms of Rubio, but along with Rand Paul find them to be the most rational and reasonable persons at the debates.","post_message":"Some say the first-term Florida senator is inexperienced. Some say he's inconsistent. And others question how his loss in Iowa is being spun into a quasi-victory."},{"comment_id":"718949644953580","commenter_b":"HAHA. Chickenshit.

Christie is probably hoping his 2016 presidential aspirations don't hinge on New Jersey voters. That's because a new Rutgers-Eagleton poll shows most Garden State voters believe he's a poor fit for the Oval Office."},{"comment_id":"583963178430303","commenter_b":"Fucking slut","commenter_a":"I think it's actually kind of good. There's a silver lining in everything. She will now live in the free world and be faced with the reality that she ruined her life. Every second of every day.
