The Media, Hollywood, Academia, Celebrities and the Elected Officials on both sides that have tainted and divided our country with their slanted, elitist opinions have finally been put in their place. This election was never about Donald Trump, it was about the people. Not the people the media falsely reported about and stereotyped. I was at two Trump rallies, these people were black, white, Hispanic, all ages and all races. People who love our country, love our constitution and the principles within it, love God and love and respect all Americans. The silent majority who we're sick and tired of being falsely portrayed as the intolerant ones, being intimidated, called names and told by an arrogant and grossly out of control government and out of touch minority what we were supposed to think, say and do. #WeThePeople #IndependenceDay2016","commenter_a":"This is about Obama, the establishment and MSM picking Clinton over Bernie.

Hell I go through super plus tampons with a super extra maxi overnight within 2 hours bc I have PCOS. I was homeless and LUCKILY people donated to the shelter and I was usually able to have what I needed. Sometimes I didn't but I would go sit in the day labor office with a bunch of homeless men, I was like the only woman there, while I was on my period, bleeding through my clothes just to go do manual labor all day so I could make $30 to buy what I needed. I fucking hate asshole people.","commenter_a":"Growing up poor, you learn to use other methods.
