The USA is goin to shit","commenter_a":"Most of the people commenting here have no concept of freedom. The beauty of America is if you don't like the way one busines does thongs, you can go to another. Using government to force people to comply is not Freedom. Should a gay baker be forced to make a cake for an anti gay group? This is a continuing attack on the rights of American's in general, just like telling businesses the can't smoke in them anymore. Just because a business is open to the public does not mean every person has a right to frequent there no matter what.","post_message":"How do YOU feel about this case?

But the billionaires? No, they don't have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes. So Trump goes around and says, 'Hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman. But I don't pay any taxes. But you, you make $15 an hour? You pay the taxes, not me,'' he said. 'That is why people are angry and want real change in this country.'","post_message":"Millions of Americans work hard and pay their taxes.
