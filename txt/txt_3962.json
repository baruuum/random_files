We can share the GOOD news that Jesus died and took our punishment for our sins but it is not our job to make people feel bad. Their hearts will know because of the Holy Spirit. We can share the news that we, too, were once sinners but now we are saints. People who come to God out of fear or condemnation usually won't stick around long because those emotions go away. People need to know that Someone has taken their punishment for sin for them and that they are loved more than words can say. We ALL are searching for love. Hope this helps.","commenter_a":"The Bible says it is the KINDNESS of God that leads people to repentance which is what it sounds to me like Joel Osteen is giving. Read the Word!!
