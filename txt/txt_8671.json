Define the act.","commenter_a":"A hate crime is an act against someone or a group of people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation or religion. Terrorism is an attack in which the victims are not relevant to the agenda. Terrorism is a statement normally made towards a government, a hate crime is a statement towards the victim, it's personal. For me I think a hate crime is more horrific, to hunt and kill someone for being who they are. Terrorism is more of an act of a coward, a hail marry pass.","post_message":"\"Why canâ€™t we own up to the fact that hate crimes are just another form of terrorism, perhaps the worst, since they target the weak among us?\" Read on in The New York Times Opinion."},{"comment_id":"10153226407581770","commenter_b":"Evil scum bags.

I did not give some simply because it would take too much time on my part to gather them (about the same it would take to do the research on CRS and FATCA's actual consequences). These are the keywords you want: FATCA CRS money laundering Nevada","commenter_a":"Jumping on the demonize Putin wagon eh, big surprise coming from vice. This has nothing to do with Putin, but I see his name a hundred times. Clearly this leak came from the u.s. How about the American banks laundering drug money, or the us govt selling weapons to drug cartels, or CIA plane crashing full of cocaine, or u.s Senator macconell s boat full of cocaine.
