For centuries, Arab and Berber traders made big profits from the highly lucrative 'business' of slavery. Millions of black Africans were captured/kidnapped from their homes, abused and sold in slave markets. Today, In places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar de facto slavery still exists. People from the Philippines, Indian subcontinent etc. live and 'work' there in subhuman conditions. This is not a history lesson. It is happening right here and now. None of this justifies in any way the crimes committed by European colonialism in general and the British Empire in particular against indigenous peoples. But I do hope Mr. Gayle (whom I respect) will not hesitate to write/speak about injustice and racism that still exist in other parts of the world - including in African and Arab nations - with the ...","post_message":"Howard Gayle: 'The education system told me nothing but lies about Africa.'"},{"comment_id":"908814249264770","commenter_b":"'@username did you know it will cost 114 billion dollars to deport 11.3 million people then add in the cost of the wall. Who would pay for that. Our taxes would have to go way up to cover that. I don't think Don can cover that out of his own pocket.","commenter_a":"I am an American. My children are American. My Grandparents and Great Grandparents were immigrants to this country. They came from Poland, Germany and Italy. I am a woman. I am successful in the male dominated auto industry. Donald Trump has spoken against every good thing I have been taught to be proud of in America. He is a ignorant, lying buffoon. #imwithher","post_message":"Yesterday, Donald J. Trump said that the judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University should be disqualified from his job because, in Trump's words, he has “Mexican heritage.”   Judge Curiel was born in Indiana—and last I checked, that's in the United States of America. Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. He’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.   Let's be clear about what Trump is saying. He thinks that because Judge Curiel's family has Mexican roots, he can’t do his job. Donald Trump isn't just wrong about this; his words show that he’s wrong about America. He’s wrong about what makes this country great. And on a day that we are mourning Muhammad Ali, let's remember that we live in a country where people can break down barriers, worship their own god, choose their own name, and lead and follow their dreams as far as their hard work and talent will take them. I’ve always believed that in America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is—we should be judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, heritage, or religion. Well, it's time to judge Donald Trump by his words and deeds. And I believe that his prejudiced, bigoted words and deeds disqualify him from being President of the United States."},{"comment_id":"10153257305683445","commenter_b":"The irony in your statement, it's because of the illegal immigrants that America discovered weed","commenter_a":"So what if be had 'pounds' across state lines..!?
