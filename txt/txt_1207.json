The 'second amendment solution' is to use the guns to kill people, and he was talking about his followers killing Secretary Clinton, and he was talking about his followers killing the judges she will appoint as President. You can try to say that he didn't actually think they would follow his advice, but you can't say that isn't what the words mean.","commenter_a":"Hmm I wonder if he's talking about the NRA?

They just took a mother from he children who were born in this country!! We are the one's who are threatening the lives of people who trusted us and came here to make their lives better, just like Trumps mother did. Just think, if they had sent her back we wouldn't be dealing with this heartless man! What a blessing that would be. He's done more damage in less than 3 weeks than Nixon did in about 6 years and he wasn't this bad!!","post_message":"Immigration agents “said she’s a threat, but my wife isn’t a threat,” her husband said in an interview."},{"comment_id":"10153875546363352","commenter_b":"Smh girl please...","commenter_a":"Let's see how much he's kicking out for a settlement","post_message":"RAPPER BRUTALLY KICKS FEMALE FAN BECAUSE SHE TOUCHED HIS SHORTS.

How many times is this now? His speeches are the same old thing. I'm going to build the wall. I'm going to ban Muslims. I don't care about constitutional rights.

That 1/2 had a crowd, the rest of the mall was sparsely filled but you could only see that from an ariel view. Crowd scientists say Trump's inauguration crowd was half the size of Obama's and they are correct, especially when you compare views of both ends of the mall--anyway--who really cares about this anymore?","commenter_a":"Obama was the first African American president I would expect the crowd to be quite larger for him","post_message":"[This comment contained a link to an external webpage which is not shown here.]"}]
