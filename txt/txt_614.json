First time for everything, I guess","post_message":"The term 'manslamming' comes from one woman's claim that she walked around NYC without moving out of anyone's way and almost every man slammed into her but almost no women did.   So National Review's Katherine Timpf decided to try it out herself  and 66 women ran into her vs. just 23 men. You can see video of all the slams here:"},{"comment_id":"10153080456176051","commenter_b":"Feral pigs are a huge problem in this country.","commenter_a":"I am NOT a liberal, and do not believe in hunting for sport! Why do people who hunt, feel the need to post morbid pictures of 'their kill' Is it to prove something?! Not many people want to see that!!","post_message":"These hunters have one message and one message only for their critics: get over it."},{"comment_id":"10154856564546438","commenter_b":"Fake IDs fake visas...so why are we sure illegals never voted?? Illegals pose threat because of how much they owe coyotes that families back in Mexico maybe threatened if they dont run drugs for cartels...Trump is right to close this border.","commenter_a":"Ooooo","post_message":"'You notice the Republicans are not saying, 'Hey, those aren the facts,' or 'something has changed,' or 'he did all these other things afterward.' No, what they saying is, 'You don get to talk about that.'"},{"comment_id":"1190105204361047","commenter_b":"Hang the bitch!","commenter_a":"Takes time to plan a coronation!!","post_message":"Hillary thinks she's already won. This kind of sick behavior is UNACCEPTABLE in a constitutional republic!"},{"comment_id":"1240022466017781","commenter_b":"'@username Yes, but less human.","commenter_a":"The correct term is undocumented immigrants. It is not right to say illegals. We are all part of the human race. As an American born citizen I say that Trump is wrong. Undocumented immigrants are very important to our work force. They work very hard. Some work harder than those born here. If we send all undocumented immigrants back it would put this nation under. Yes we have a immigration problem. But fix it the right way. Undocumented immigrants deserve a chance as we all do to live in a country like ours.","post_message":"Under the Eisenhower program, immigrants inside the U.S. were rounded up and deported to remote places, resulting in deaths and criticism of human rights abuses."},{"comment_id":"1024965370917718","commenter_b":"'@username Agreed!","commenter_a":"Being vegetarian doesn't change much in the lives of cattle however. Nor hens. It's better than being an omnivore, yes, but still not cruelty free. Although nothing truly is. From medical treatments, medicine, to our pets sustenance, to palm oil, to beauty and household products, etc. As for diet, we are naturally omnivorous. We would not have survived very well as a species without meat as sustenance and the remainder for clothing/tools, along with plants, fruits, nuts, etc. Especially in the North.","post_message":"[This comment contained a link to an external webpage which is not shown here.]"},{"comment_id":"10153223686721336","commenter_b":"Why is she still walking around and not in an orange jumpsuit?","commenter_a":"Is she resigning?
