Both President Bush and President Clinton used their State of the Union address following difficult midterm elections to acknowledge that they no longer have control of both chambers and that it was time for them to work with Congress. Unfortunately, tonight was another missed opportunity for President Obama and his legacy.    President Obama used this evening to appease his political base and focused on dividing our Nation and using bureaucratic control to run our country with top-down Washington-centered solutions. I believe the key to growing a healthy economy begins by strengthening the paycheck of hard working Americans, putting more money into Kansans pockets, and growing our economy from the bottom-up.     While I was disappointed in many of the President's remarks, I remain hopeful there will be opportunities in the near future to work together to expand trade and fix our broken tax code. I remain hopeful that this President will seize those opportunities just as those who preceded him did."},{"comment_id":"517056128505278","commenter_b":"@username I'm pretty sure much of what you typed is not true.","commenter_a":"Hillary should be forced to work as the next ambassador to Libya.

Switzerland has a population of 8 million people, according to Trump's plan, he would deport the equivalent of every single person living in Switzerland and then SOME not only it is CRAZY, it's impossible. ..for the sake of argument let's say it was possible, it would cost billions and billions of dollars and take decades to accomplish that.","commenter_a":"I think people are going to vote donald trump for president","post_message":"Saying goodbye to some of my great workers at Trump National Doral Miami."}]
