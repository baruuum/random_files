Had she left room between her and the vehicle in front of her, she would have had adequate time to take evasive action to avoid the mattress and been able to maintain control of her vehicle. Both trucks were traveling at a reasonable and prudent speed. The ford was passim the semi safely. She grew impatient. Ford took evasive action, maintained control of his vehicle. She was tailgating and did not have time to take evasive action SAFELY. Over corrected and lost control of her vehicle. She is 100% at fault. There is no negligence on either driver. Her car is obviously totaled hopefully she carries collision coverage. She will also be paying for the damage to the semi. Hope she has enough liability. I am a claims adjuster. I explain this to people allllllllll day. She was impatient, and now she will have ...","post_message":"TAILGATING GONE WRONG: Watch as a car that was tailgating another vehicle on the I-10 ends up ramming into a semi-truck and flipping in the air.

I like his energy and desire to solve problems, and he seems to be willing to change when something isn't working..unlike most politicians who refuse to admit when they're wrong. However, (and this is an example) when Hillary says he doesn't believe in climate change, he needs to back up his position with facts on why. Sure she can say scientists believe in it..well not all of them do. Trump needs to bring up scientists that don't support that theory. Also I would like to see him release his taxes, so she can't bring it up anymore.","post_message":"'CNBC, Time magazine online polls say Donald Trump won the first presidential debate' via The Washington Times."},{"comment_id":"10157370446315354","commenter_b":"Let a woman kill them.","commenter_a":"Bring see how many get wiped out America is not afraid of you cowards","post_message":"As the ISIS cancer grows, the threat comes closer and closer."},{"comment_id":"10153829560109062","commenter_b":"Illegals dont fil lout any forms,","commenter_a":"Who tell him Illegal immigrates do not pay taxes, there are special forms most of them pay by the end of the year simce they know if there a possibility to change their status they will have to show they paid taxes...

It takes the 1% to contribute the 99% of us that couldn't keep the economy a float without there financial support or contributions to the economy. What is ruining our economy is supporters like yourselves who probably believe in giving the minorities a place to stand in the bread line while they send there un-taxed & undocumented earnings home to there families living like royalty on the backs of the mighty American dollar. While the rest of registered documented citizens pay our taxes to make America great. I am all for immigrants who are here legally and lawfully it's you stupid idiots who support the system in the blind to allow otherwise.","commenter_a":"Racist people are coming out the woodworks. They are attacking Donald Trumps campaigned because they are to stupid to understand the truths of our Society. To stupid to understand simple economics, taxes and laws.

Besides him not banning Muslims from Saudi Arabia - because they have \"great human rights\" over there from Women not being allowed to drive or throwing Gays off of roof tops; Trump says US will prioritize Christian refugees. How do you determine who is a Christian when one can easily lie about this? Congress will likely overturn this. While they're at it, Trump stop droning brown people overseas and Congress stop sending foreign aid to these terrorist organizations who indirectly receive it.","commenter_a":"Good","post_message":"BREAKING: President Trump has signed an executive order indefinitely banning all refugees from war-torn Syria and suspending all refugee entry for at least 120 days."},{"comment_id":"691363511054227","commenter_b":"Get a life and leave her alone!!","commenter_a":"She must be an AWESOME girl as she brings out the second, third, etc. class haters !!!???
