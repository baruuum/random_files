Should they be punished for what they did? Yes! No one who made any of these comments could be their parents I'm sure or you wouldn't be saying such hate filled things. No one is going to win in situations like this, I pray all the families and businesses can come back from this, I pray something can be salvaged somewhere. And I pray everyone who has hate in their hearts can change. This world would be a much better place if people loved like they are supposed to, to much greed and hate now. How would any of you feel if they were your family members or if you lost someone. I'm sure some of you are christians?? Think about what you could do for someone instead of spreading hatred and negativity!","post_message":"JUST IN: 2 juveniles have been charged with starting the Tennessee wildfire that killed 14 people."},{"comment_id":"10153415321678812","commenter_b":"Stacey shutup stupid","commenter_a":"So how does something hitting the windshield really effect a train on tracks?
