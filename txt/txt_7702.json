You people talk about a divided Nation? Kids are being harrassed at school for \"appearing\" to be Muslim, some are Indians. Muslim's are of every nationality and not just middle eastern. Donald Trump has created HATE amongst people of a brown tone. That's more than 3/4 of the Nation. You people are scum that support Trump. American Mexican's are being mis-treated too. I guarantee you that Donald Trump will turn this country 3rd world with his talk of our \"wages are too high\" and \"we must COMPETE with wages of Mexico, Japan and China\". YES, he is a 'business man\" and that's why HE sent his own manufacturing jobs out of the U.S. Think, people, think.","commenter_a":"I find it hilarious when Obama is blamed by Republicans for everything under the sun, but now he's being blamed for helping create Donald Trump.
