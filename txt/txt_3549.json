It calls for a WELL-REGULATED militia. Not just any white supremecist or Al Qaida operative who goes to a gun show. In Vermont you have fewer urban areas. It is like saying nobody gets mugged on a row boat. I am a gun owner and I really wish that buttholes like you and these NRA pimps with your illiterate interpretation of the second amendment would go help someone else. Ammosexuals are giving responsible gun owners a bad name.","post_message":"\"A law requiring people to apply for a permit before buying a handgun helped Connecticut quietly reduce its firearm-related homicide rate by 40 percent.\" Imagine how many lives could be saved if other states passed similar laws."},{"comment_id":"10153649421859138","commenter_b":"Why would you post such a thing Dan???

It's a talking point. I am a white Christian and I hate his policies. Not him. I hate socialism. It's working do well in Venezuela. The dems are the ones throwing the race card around to get people's minds off the facts. For example, a few people have health care now that didn't before.
