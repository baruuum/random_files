At first it seemed a bit strange to me, then I thought \"Oh well, if a 60 year old can do that, I can, too\". That was when I stopped caring. As for underpants, not enough fabric, so I'll pass.","commenter_a":"Stupid debate. Why should it bother me how people sunbathe? I don't care if they are dressed, half naked or naked.
