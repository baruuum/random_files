By defining racism and things like \"cultural appropriation\" as the reasons for failure of African Americans to succeed fundamentally points to solutions in the wrong place. If tomorrow, every last vestige of racism were lifted in society, would Blacks suddenly be elevated? No. The cultural deficit of the Black community is the key. Lack of educational attainment, intact families, communities with massive violence, lack of role models all are the key reasons for failure. These problems may stem from historic racism but they are not solved by eliminating racism today. So, when the BLM movement focuses on racism they are actually focusing in on the wrong items. Lifting small racists issues without fixing the basic cultural failings will do nothing. In 10 years, we may have few elements of racism left and a black community with problems ...","post_message":"\" ‘You’re free,’ they keep telling us.

I voted for this sales increase to pay for the improvements that put my city on the list of one of the best cities to live. Low crime, lush, great shopping, great roads, many services, about 15 parks, good schools and I live in a well kept condo complex where my HOA dues are over 300.00. The only blight I ever see are the smelly, stained mattresses and unwanted cheap furniture that slobs leave next to the more than amble sized trash areas. They dump in the middle of the night bec they're too cheap to pay to have them hauled away properly. My neighbors and I have concluded it is the renters here. They have no stake in keeping up the complex. The HOA pays for the removal weekly. The trash man ...","commenter_a":"Disgraceful.","post_message":"Do you have a discarded mattress on your block?
