What that means is, if one chooses to go against the 'rules' then that is on them. Its called \"free will\". I would advise against it according to my own spiritual belief's...but I have no right to take it any further than that with a non-believer. Its a touchy subject! We all have a gay person in our lives somewhere that we love, we may not like or agree with this life-style, and we do have a right to \"voice\" that, but that is where the right ends, and the rights of the gay person start...I only wish now the gays would see where THEIR rights end when dealing with those of us that are Not gay, and we do have Divine & Constitutional to disagree, but ...","post_message":"Marriage should be defined as it has always been.

Stop illegal aliens from getting jobs here, no papers=no jobs or sending our money to help other countries when we have plenty of homelessness & poverty here in our own country. Fix this country first b4 you try to fix others.. Children here need help just like across the world, we have Veteran's dieing & sleeping on streets, starving people & animals everywhere. And the only way something is ever done is when there's some sorta tragedy. The whole state (country) is in need of change. We need to correct us b4 we try to help others.","post_message":"WATCH LIVE: Gov. Rick Scott is in Orlando giving a briefing on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's counterterrorism efforts.
