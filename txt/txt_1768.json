The victim opened the door to the attacker after he knocked, apparently targeting her at random, police said. He pushed into the apartment and beat her, but she was 'feisty' and able to fight him off, an LAPD captain said.  The man, who was caught on surveillance video, is described as a black man 25 to 30 years old, 6 feet tall, 220 pounds. He wore a black Penn State hoodie at the time of the attack."}]
