The mess that the Dumbocrats likes you and Nag Nancy supported along with the idiot in the White House. You and the fools like you are no longer \"hilarious\" you are dangerous! You need to educate your foolish self and quit endangering the rest of us!","commenter_a":"Hilarious!!! GOP makes us think we are in momentary threat of something or other and then Refuses to Fund the operating system for oour Defense!!!","post_message":"The clock is ticking and still, Republicans are trapped in a dangerous, anti-immigrant fantasy. This is the second time this week that Republicans have voted to continue threatening the security of American families, doubling down on their breathtaking irresponsibility.

I'd rather look at and hear him than her.","commenter_a":"Guess Rush has already forgotten all of Trump's promises to \"cut deals\" with all the Reids and Pelosis out there. The left probably won't have to worry very much.","post_message":"I want you to fast forward to November to Trump winning the presidency in November. I want you to think, using your intelligence guided by experience, what's gonna happen that night? What's gonna happen the next day? What's going to happen every day thereafter? What's gonna happen the day Trump gets inaugurated? What is the left gonna do? They're not gonna just sit idly by and accept this and say, \"Good fight. We gave it everything we had, but we lost.\" They're gonna do everything they can to undermine it. And I think we're gonna see levels of violence that we have not seen."},{"comment_id":"638139039652611","commenter_b":"They paid her less cause she sucked ass!","commenter_a":"It's true cause Brian Williams was there","post_message":"YEAH!!!!!!!!!"},{"comment_id":"10155017567319628","commenter_b":"That's a lie Muslim DID NOT HELP BUILD AMERICA","commenter_a":"that is wrong, they (muslims) had no part in building America.","post_message":"Ohio State University is now teaching students that Muslims helped build America"},{"comment_id":"1990611657665239","commenter_b":"Another vile rapefugee","commenter_a":"death penalty anyone ?? #asktrump","post_message":"Horrifying."},{"comment_id":"10152967857461519","commenter_b":"Yeah, I am sure all the female open carriers/ gun owners are using firearms to compensate for their small penis'","commenter_a":"Tari, have you ever actually read the second amendment? It calls for a WELL-REGULATED militia. Not just any white supremecist or Al Qaida operative who goes to a gun show. In Vermont you have fewer urban areas. It is like saying nobody gets mugged on a row boat. I am a gun owner and I really wish that buttholes like you and these NRA pimps with your illiterate interpretation of the second amendment would go help someone else. Ammosexuals are giving responsible gun owners a bad name.","post_message":"\"A law requiring people to apply for a permit before buying a handgun helped Connecticut quietly reduce its firearm-related homicide rate by 40 percent.\" Imagine how many lives could be saved if other states passed similar laws."}]
