This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House. Islamic immigration to the US would be prohibited under this law because the Koran, Sharia Law and the Hadith all require complete submission to Islam, which is antithetical to the ...","post_message":"“Anytime somebody is making inflammatory statements about Muslims or whatever, they can take that and use it to their advantage for recruiting purposes,” House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep.

End of that discussion. With that said, I sincerely hope Carson never holds any public office at this stage of his life due to what appears to be his deteriorating mental faculties. He is running for president of my country so that is a legitimate comment of my concern of his abilities. This comment does not in any way extend to any members of his family.","post_message":"He's a candidate, so that means she is automatically in the spotlight - but do people really need to be so cruel?"}]
