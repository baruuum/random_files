Genital mutilation has no semblance of a relation to Islam. It's a cultural problem endemic of Northern Africa, not Islam (Christians and Jews from this region have the same problems with this practice).","commenter_a":"Yeah, except this ancient religion doesn't through gays off buildings, mutilate female sexual organs, and and want to kill anyone who doesn't become a Jedi!

Hehehehehehehehe One good thing people should learn is that Muslims from the unset, have always wanted to dominate. Whether Muslims like it or not, Israel of today will never succumb to them again. If Israel is the problem of the world, then Palestinians should try and leave the land of Israel and let's see whom Israel will kill again. Thousands are dying in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, yet it's not a problem to the world peace. Tell that to the birds. Never ever succumb to the demands of any Muslim community, if u give them one today, tomorrow they will demand for 3. Always push them back or they will over run u. This is why i pity Europe,maybe they are not ...","post_message":"Syrian government has conducted nearly 7,000 air strikes during the month of July, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, making it the most intense bombing reported in one month since the beginning of the conflict in 2011. @webpagelink"}]
