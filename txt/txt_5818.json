But it's probably time for some birth control. 3 kids at 20 is quite a bit, but 6 is a lot (seeing as if they weren't twins someone would have to start around 13 and have a baby every year so I'm sure it hasn't happened much)","post_message":"\"My regrets would be timing, but I'm really happy that I can even create babies or have life because some women can't do that,\" 20-year-old Danesha Couch said."},{"comment_id":"10154521229303318","commenter_b":"Start building the wall","commenter_a":"The idiot has border fences all along southern Mexico whats that for.

They have no right to a trial. They have no right to a defense. They are automatically guilty and only entitled to deportation. If you want to be American there is a legal way. It is not easy nor will it be quick. But if you are willing to do it the legal way then you get to become an American and stay without fear of deportation.","post_message":"Janet Napolitano says the University of California will vigorously protect illegal immigrants."}]
