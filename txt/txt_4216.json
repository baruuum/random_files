The Republican primary was stronger because of the ideas he brought forth.   Marcoâ€™s story embodies the promise of our great nation. I know he will continue to be a champion for limitless opportunity in America, and I wish Marco, Jeanette, and their four kids the very best."},{"comment_id":"1638130873118424","commenter_b":"@username we have to save American lives and that means keeping Hillary Clinton out of our WH!!!","commenter_a":"Desperate - can't stop the \"Trump Train\"! It's way too late - you GOP establishment idiots are the ones who are making it possible for the democrats to get 4 more years to continue to destroy this country! Just because Mr Trump doesn't lean to the \"far\" right, doesn't mean he's not a Republican! I don't lean to the \"far\" right, but I am a Republican! It's time for some real middle of the road compromising - more real and true policies will get passed and the stagnant economy, security, and the best welfare of Americans will come to fruition! Won't buy national review ever again - especially since they have nuts like beck involved!","post_message":"As it's starting to look more like Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee, some in the conservative movement are viciously attacking the NYC businessman.

Nor hens. It's better than being an omnivore, yes, but still not cruelty free. Although nothing truly is. From medical treatments, medicine, to our pets sustenance, to palm oil, to beauty and household products, etc. As for diet, we are naturally omnivorous. We would not have survived very well as a species without meat as sustenance and the remainder for clothing/tools, along with plants, fruits, nuts, etc. Especially in the North.","post_message":""}]
