How much did she actually ingest if she took a sip and said it tasted funny?","commenter_a":"Clearly this is not cool, but accidents do happen in life. She drank a tiny amount of watered down sangria, not methylated spirits or even vodka. I think the parents are massively over reacting. I would be angry, but come on, a few sips of cheap wine mixed with orange juice is not going to kill a small child.","post_message":"She was rushed to the hospital drunk"},{"comment_id":"10152986192691491","commenter_b":"You're an odd little woman","commenter_a":"Malala is big drama queen , thousand of girl are raped and kill no body knows why malal","post_message":"Malala gunmen secretly set free in Pakistan @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1861753934052329","commenter_b":"I'm pretty sure @username was being sarcastic","commenter_a":"Lol wow. That tool didn't \"destroy\" anything. He just confirmed how idiotic the Obama administration is and how clueless they are when it comes to guns. He says the guns were legally purchased in California, but then says if there were \"common sense gun laws\", terrorists would change their mind about committing acts of terrorism, completely ignoring the fact that the legally purchased guns in California were purchased under the \"common sense gun laws\" you faggots have been calling for!!! Here is a question, have common sense pot laws prevented any of you jackasses from buying and smoking your weed?? Have common sense alcohol laws, like making it completely illegal to drink and drive, ended deaths caused by DUIs!?

I think what these kids did was dumb. Question is..\"is it only offensive to hear these words when it comes from a non black individual? Or is it also as offensive to black person if their their own race uses the word to announce their friendship\"? What up my n..... You all have heard it. Its in every horrible rap lyric. Its used daily in schools and on the streets. RESPECT IS RESPECT. there is no off time when the word is offensive or not. So its an honest question. Why is it Not offensive in music or when used by black people toward other black people?","post_message":"I'M SORRY: One Desert Vista High School senior, who posed for a picture while spelling out a racial slur, apologized yesterday during a rally.
