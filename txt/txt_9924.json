How frightening it must be to them when their Chaldean brethren in Iraq and Syria are being systematically cleansed from their centuries-old homelands under Muslim rule.

I think what these kids did was dumb. Question is..\"is it only offensive to hear these words when it comes from a non black individual? Or is it also as offensive to black person if their their own race uses the word to announce their friendship\"? What up my n..... You all have heard it. Its in every horrible rap lyric. Its used daily in schools and on the streets. RESPECT IS RESPECT. there is no off time when the word is offensive or not. So its an honest question.

The couple wasn't discriminated against. The kliens simply didn't want to participate in something they deem as sinful. How is that forcing their beliefs on them. So now they are out of business and the militant intolerant left made it happen. While our backward minded liberal pals are doing their best to persecute Christians at the same time and probably at this very moment Muslim bakers regularly turn away gays. These incidents do get reported but the liberal media refuses to report on them and the militant LGBT stay silent.","post_message":"A Daily Signal Exclusive: Bakers Facing $135K Fine Over Wedding Cake for Same-Sex Couple Speak Out"},{"comment_id":"10154530300669087","commenter_b":"I'm guessing the attorneys general in question are more aware of the law than you, random Facebook commenter.","commenter_a":"The Inadmissible Aliens Act Section 8 - 1182 allows the President to ban any group or nationality from getting Visas.
