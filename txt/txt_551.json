All the smelt live in temperature controlled tanks at UC Davis... to the tune of about $2.5 million tax payer dollars per year. THE SMELT ARE GONE, no matter what they do in the delta. If it weren't the smelt, another fish or animal would be chosen to take its place. We're suckers... hook, line, and sinker! Israel had severe water shortages too... they are now able to be a water exporter. They built reclamation, desalinization, and now have more than they need. California is building an f'ing bullet train to nowhere! But, what if a smelt got pulled into the desalinization plant intake?","commenter_a":"Maybe if our state government quit selling our water rights to Evian arrowhead dasani etc we wouldn't have this problem","post_message":"BREAKING NEWS: California water regulators adopted sweeping, unprecedented restrictions Tuesday on how people, governments and businesses can use water amid the state's ongoing drought. abc7.la/1QkO1GA"},{"comment_id":"10156250000825354","commenter_b":"This leftist democrat is trying to push the blame to christian Americans.

She is then ordered to return again, and the judge becomes furious with her attitude. “Did you say ‘f--- you’? Did you say that?” the judge asks. “Yes sir, I did,” the girl responds. “Oh you did say that?” the judge replies. “I find you in direct criminal contempt.
