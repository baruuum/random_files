She waited too long to intervene and then did it in anger. That is unprofessional. BUT.... The parent who allows their child to disturb all the people around them trying to enjoy a meal is inconsiderate and selfish! The excuse that the child is waiting too long for food is poor at best. You as a parent and should come prepared to entertain your child... That includes providing them snacks and toys. The parents should have removed that child from the table within 5 minutes of the unresolved tantrum. Yes... I am a parent and never allowed that to happen. Remember that you are not the only person in that establishment spending hard earned money to enjoy a simple meal!","post_message":"DINER OWNER YELLS AT CRYING CHILD: \"I turned around, slammed both hands on the counter and then pointed at the child and said, 'This has got to stop!'\" said Darla Neugebauer, after she says a toddler cried for more than 40 minutes.
