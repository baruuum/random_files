I would rather give black thugs target practice so that they don't hit innocent bystanders when trying to shoot each other.","commenter_a":"SCREW BLM...","post_message":"A controversy has erupted at Dartmouth College after a pro-police display was torn down by Black Lives Matter activists, who denounced it for memorializing the \"perpetrators\" of \"state violence.\""},{"comment_id":"859150960886345","commenter_b":"You weren't forced to come either bitch!","commenter_a":"It kills me that someone who is not even from America can say such racist crap @username. Just remember or learn about the history of slavery and the continued discrimination today from immigrants like you who wasn't forced on a boat to come here. It's because of African Americans you have the freedoms you have today. Please don't comment on something you know nothing about and actually learn about the injustices African American people are facing today. You sound just like these ignorant people who always got something to say behind closed doors. I guess you wouldn't know about white supremacy because you've bought in to this bs white people have taught you in America. I guess all the killings by white police is something new. You have no idea what it's like to be black and to get even immigrants being racist towards you the same immigrants Martin Luther ...","post_message":"The Debt Collection Industry Is the Epitome of Systematic Racism"},{"comment_id":"1518093821534153","commenter_b":"Cindi Marcum then why do you ppl think that muslims have the right to travel to the u.s. and and park their lazy asses here, mooch off of us and kill at will while trying to enforce their barbaric ways of life on us....hmmmm?","commenter_a":"So if it's in the rights of the protesters to block a road where does my rights to travel freely fit into that agenda so I can say get to work , seek medical attention or buy food , ect","post_message":"Wow!

Never worked did it. This is a religious war. It's in their unholy book and no amount of appeasement will fix them. Their founders motto was \"CONVERT or DIE\". This is simple stuff. Read it. Understand it and don't give in to it. I admire the cartoonists for their bravery. That COEXIST bumper sticker should be pulled off every car on every liberal college campus and off every Subaru in liberal Minnesota and sent to some Islamist nation. We coexist VERY well. Our early settlers didn't kill the Indians who didn't convert. Our Founders didn't work that way either. We are not the ones who need the lecture. We wrote the book on getting along. They don't care to read it.","commenter_a":"Dear Muslims....COEXIST....
