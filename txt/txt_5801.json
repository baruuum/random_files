Just asking the question tells me that you still haven't figured out exactly how fed up people are with the Republican leadership. They, and their democratic counterparts are the reason people are crying for term limits.","post_message":"You decide..."},{"comment_id":"510102432525283","commenter_b":"What a dumbass!","commenter_a":"Well duh!!! I thought everyone knew the all you can eat means is all YOU, just you, only you, your stomach, can hold, I didn't realize that there were ppl stupid enough to think they could go into a restaurant and get the all you can eat whatever and feed 5 or 6 of your friends on YOUR all YOU can eat ....are ppl really out there that are that stupid ? If so for the love of God spay and neuter them so as to prevent them from bringing more ridiculously stupid ignorant ppl into this world","post_message":"The Denny's workers here repeatedly tried to explain the rules about all-you-can-eat-pancakes to this lady - and that's when she completely snapped."},{"comment_id":"10152952082057452","commenter_b":"Shes beautiful","commenter_a":"So precious!","post_message":"This video of a baby seeing her parentsâ€™ faces for the first time after getting glasses will melt your heart: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10150883310494999","commenter_b":"will have to wait to see how many generics fail to work","commenter_a":"There is going to be generic?

If we can't afford social programs to help the people of this country, how the fuck are we gonna pay for a war? Not a Bernie fan, but you can't trash one candidate because \"We can't afford him\" when Trump wants to cut shitloads of taxes, and THEN try to finance a mass deportation, a war, and then a wall. Don't even get me started on how prices will shoot up on produce, as well as anything illegal immigrants touch.","commenter_a":"Honestly Bernie Sanders not winning would make me lose complete hope for the US. They are being presented with one of the most honest, genuine, good hearted humans possible, yet they prefer to give the likes of Donald Drumpf and Hillary Cliton their attention.

I think this hostility stems from a fragile male ego and jealousy of the women's hard work and progress. A woman's progress only threatens weak men because now he sees the woman as competition when all she is trying to do is make something for herself and better her life.

Its really all jealousy. I've heard these types of men complain that \"An educated black woman will render the black male useless, and produce less babies, thus destroying the black race\", which really reveals that they rather you be stupid and uneducated and a baby factory, than self sufficient and educated.
