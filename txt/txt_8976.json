They are aiming to make all of America a soft target. Whose side are they on, anyway? Never mind, I think we know. Vote out all liberal, progressive, Democrats.

When reason and logic doesn't work, you know the NRA propaganda has got a serious grip on us. We've shown the world how much our armed gun citizenry has worked - America's mass shootings are on a continuous news cycle being aired around the world.
