I have contacts within both campaigns. Here what I was told yesterday and today. Clinton campaign to vote down every concession made to Bernie on the platform if he did not endorse her prior to the convention. Knowing that Superdelegates were not going to switch to his side without something major happening, the best he could do was hold on to the progressive concessions he won for US on the platform. He could not, in good consciousness let the GOP and Trump win, especially when we have a potential half of the Supreme Court Justices that will be replaced within the next 4-8 years. He was looking out for the future of our movement and our nation in this very hard decision he made. This post is not to tell you to vote for Hillary, or to not leave ...","post_message":"In the coming weeks, I will be announcing the creation of successor organizations to carry on the struggle that we have been a part of these past 15 months. I hope you will continue to be involved in fighting to transform America. Our goal will be to advance the progressive agenda that we believe in and to elect like-minded candidates at the federal, state and local levels who are committed to accomplishing our goals."},{"comment_id":"566696260200553","commenter_b":"They can go now","commenter_a":"Hope she goes","post_message":"It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country to Qatar in the event Donald Trump wins this election."},{"comment_id":"1207587629262246","commenter_b":"Yeah they're adorable haha, the way they move :D","commenter_a":"@username they are so cute lol","post_message":"<3 penguins Watch the full video here: bit.ly/1Fxpjfk Video by John Downer Productions.

Its physically impossible unless the standards are lowered (this has been repeatedly proven in Marine infantry officer course) and lower standards WILL KILL PEOPLE IN COMBAT. People that want women in ground combat either have not the slightest idea what it is OR had a far different experience than most infantrymen of my generation had. There are no bathrooms in the field. There are no showers for weeks or months sometimes. But maybe its easier now. But I doubt SF or Seals are.","commenter_a":"Everybody should be held to the same physical standards to do the job. Man or woman.
