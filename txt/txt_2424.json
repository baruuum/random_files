I look at this and than think back to Ferguson and Baltimore, what a difference. And yet so many times I have listened to liberals post on @username about the hateful, bigoted small minded people of the south. God Bless the people of Charleston and the families of the victims of this hateful crime.","commenter_a":"Hold on, those who love God will see you through, especially, those from that Church and all Churches that love the Lord Jesus Christ.","post_message":"“Oh my lord, he’s done made our life a living hell.

Bye bitch","commenter_a":"Bullcrap","post_message":"A recent legislative proposal from Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) would require Americans to obtain liability insurance before exercising their 2nd Amendment rights.

This makes them a little more equal. Be careful what you wish for you just might get it","commenter_a":"I had 3 sons and they all registered when they turned of age. I would have not wanted them to go but if I had a daughter which I don't I would not want her to be drafted and put in the position of getting captured. It is bad enough what they do to men when captured you can imagine what they would do to women before doing to them what they do to men. I do now have a grand daughter and a grandson. I hope neither of them ever have to go thru a war. I also hope everyone else's kids don't either.","post_message":"The Senate voted this week to require women to register for the draft.

He was a cold blooded killer, how's that heroic?","commenter_a":"That bit about Jewish controlled media ... Whoa! How repetitive. And untrue. A sniper's job is to reduce the length of war by taking out one person at a time who appears to be aiding the killing of Americans. Thus Not mowing down a big group, thus not continuing backlash. Yes, he died young, at age 38. The movie is portraying the truth.","post_message":""}]
