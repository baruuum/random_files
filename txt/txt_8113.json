Heck, even their naming scheme. About the only difference today is they do most things in aluminum instead of white plastic, but it still has the same design queues. But who can blame them? When you have so many people branded to buy your products without blinking, change would be scary.","commenter_a":"Let's hope so. Apples design has been stale & stagnant for the last 15 years. For a company who is lauded for it's design, I can't believe It's gone this long without some fresh blood or new design ideas.","post_message":"Jony Ive just got promoted to Apple's C-suite.

But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing. Titus 2:4-5 Teach the young women to be ... obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 1 Peter 3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.","commenter_a":"Well... how is this a surprise? Their bible backs up this ideology and states women are lesser creatures, that their only value is their ability to produce offspring and see to their husband's needs. That's all women are to conservative Christians- breeding stock.","post_message":"If youâ€™re a woman youâ€™re likely going to want to deck this a**hole for what he just said."},{"comment_id":"10153141451562894","commenter_b":"She a dub","commenter_a":"@username ðŸ˜•","post_message":"Kylie Jenner literally just went from 100 to 0"},{"comment_id":"1309663882411384","commenter_b":"Thank you! Someone with a little logic about the abortion! It should not be tax payer funded and it should NoT be past 12 weeks and it should not be used just because some idiot woman didn't use birth control and doesn't wanna deal with the consequences of her actions !","commenter_a":"I can not believe that abortion is a right to be discussed in 2016. It is a womans right to decide! It is our bodies!! As long as it happens before the 12th week...but women need to use their head and not use this as birthcontrol! Protect yourself if you don't want a kid! As I said, it is 2016 and we do have many types of birthcontrol!","post_message":"Obama's last stand"},{"comment_id":"592558244260673","commenter_b":"The wall will at least stop them from driving & walking over the border.","commenter_a":"build the wall in Mexico","post_message":"Will Trump build the wall?
