It's like we're protesting something that happens 1 time out of 1,000,000. And nobody cares about something that happens like everyday. The media has got the people riled up about a very small issue while ignoring major problems. That's why I don't understand this movement. It's like if the government was repossessing everyone's home and moving them to refugee camps for no reason, but I was protesting the governments estate tax while ignoring people's homes being taken.","post_message":"Does the Michigan Football players' silent protest make you uncomfortable?
