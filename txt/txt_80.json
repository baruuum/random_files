The USA is far better than this. Be bold, represent your district, and stand against the unconstitutional, corrupt administration that has taken office. The administration's actions should be leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work closely together and assert power as the legislative branch, rather than acting as an extension of the executive branch. #NoBanNoWall","commenter_a":"Congressman Reichert, I believe it is important to remember that the United States of America is a REPRESENTATIVE republic. As our elected REPRESENTATIVE, please REPRESENT the people of your District. You were elected to REPRESENT the people of the 8th Congressional District of the State of Washington (NOT Donald Trump).","post_message":"Careful vetting to ensure the safety of the American people is the responsibility of the federal government and one I take very seriously. Unfortunately what we saw this past weekend was mass confusion and miscommunication between government agencies and the improper apprehension of people legally allowed to be in the US. I urge the administration to work with Congress on solutions that protect our borders while maintaining our nation's dedication to compassion and religious freedom."},{"comment_id":"10154010252346350","commenter_b":"The kid didn't make a mistake. If she was driving drunk then she committed a crime. Having someone plow into your home is not only traumatic at the time of the event, but then there are all of the repairs to deal with. It can take months to get it all put back together. And insurance doesn't cover all of the costs. Guess who gets to pick that up. Not the kid. She wasn't over reacting. If anything, she was quite conservative. I would have gladly beat the stuffing out of the one that hit us.","commenter_a":"I'm probably the only one who is think Kim... Is.. Well... Being a little actress like in all these tweets. We get it. The kid made a mistake. One that could of been fatal. One tweet is probably good enough (if at all) but like 4? Get a grip Kim. Ridiculous.","post_message":"'This young girl could have killed herself, her friends, and me.
