How about showing how her loved ones are affected by her stealing, a family intervention. How about telling her that you love her and if there's ever anything that she needs, she can ALWAYS come to her father!","post_message":"Too far or just punishment?"},{"comment_id":"966205513390919","commenter_b":"Ms Quintana what a selfish, entitled attitude you have. Who is going to pay to train the temp, who is going to have to take on the extra duty of getting them up to speed, and who is going to pick up the slack while they get adjusted? Someone has to make up for that lost productivity. So the woman makes a decision to have a baby, and everyone around her pays for that decision. How is that fair? And not only that, but she expects to waltz back in a year later like nothing happened! She will most likely have to be retrained, creating yet another burden on top of kicking out the person who has done her job for the past year. Why should that temp have to step aside because queen mommy came back? Shouldn't that be HER job now? Why should she have to step aside ...","commenter_a":"How very \"pro-life\" of them ;). It's no wonder some women need abortions, if you can lose your job or be forced to go on unpaid leave while pregnant, and there's no maternity leave after you have your child... having a child can seriously cause you financial distress to the point of ruin! States need to pick one or the other! You can't be pro-life if you're not going to support a woman who has a child at all.","post_message":"\"I loved my job.

Now that is one right out lie! It's like our government makes the rules up has they go! Hillary Clinton gets away with right out murder and Breaking the laws. But Donald Trump can't be our president because they know that all of there Dirty Work will come out for all of us to know and that is what they are scared of . Obama did not get enough delicates but they let him run for president and they new that there was a lot of people who where not for Obama. They just was scared of what the Black people would do if he was not picked to run for president. Well you better be scared of all of us people that is fead up with our government ...","commenter_a":"I do love Newt. stay the course Trump.","post_message":"\"Newt Gingrich on ‘Anti-Trump’ Republicans: Should Form Lost Republicans for Hillary.\""},{"comment_id":"1296455407059683","commenter_b":"No they should be given sentences building the wall then deported for ever","commenter_a":"Agree","post_message":""}]
