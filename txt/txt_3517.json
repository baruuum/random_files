I won't be watching TLC if this is true. We can forgive things stars, football players, and men in charge of our country, but we can't forgive something a 12-year-old boy did.

This is what he will be. He has done us the great service of showing his true face, not the shiny, practiced veneer of the professional politician. Whether he learns to act presidential or not, this is the man you will be getting if you vote for him, a man who wants to pull out a measuring tape to settle disputes over issues. The fact of the matter is that there are no good choices this time. There aren't even any ok choices. But this man is a bully with all the character flaws that go with that, and he will do almost as much damage to this country as Clinton or Sanders. I am seriously dismayed by the continued popularity of this man, but I am equally dismayed by my other choices. And I am dismayed with a general electorate who ...","commenter_a":"It's past time for him to be acting more presidential. He also needs to do some research in preparation for the debates. Chris Wallace made him look like a fool when he put up those slides on his economic plan. He's making it harder and harder to not only defend him to skeptics, but to also remain an enthusiastic supporter instead of being a reluctant one.","post_message":"Despite what polls had shown days before Super Saturday, DONALD TRUMP lost two of the four states on Saturday to Sen. Ted Cruz, and the states he did win were at a lesser margin than predicted.  Some supporters and pundits are placing the blame on Trump's performance during the Thursday night debate, stating his \"less than presidential\" behavior is catching up to him.  In the past, DT has stated he will act more presidential when the time is right, so we ask you to take our poll knowing DML will read the results later tonight on UNFILTERED.

These children and their families are fleeing extreme violence in Central America and they should have a chance to seek relief, which is why I introduced the “Fair Day in Court for Kids Act” — a bill that mandates counsel for these vulnerable individuals.
