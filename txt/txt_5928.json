And the sad fact of it is that now we will never know how many of them were being honest and how many are lying for the limelight. Cases like this only cast doubt on instances of rape, unfortunately.

Did the office overreact, perhaps. What do you do with a teenager that doesn't listen to authority? Continue to let her disrupt the class? This girls deserves to be punished.
