Look back at this entire election process; every single act of violence was committed by the left, either A Bernie or a Hillary protester. EVERY single one of them.","commenter_a":"Tim like all rightwingers always blame someone else; it's SOP. This and other acts of violence is just a taste of what will happen if Trump is elected. Those prone to such acts will take it as de facto permission for violent acts against blacks, Latinos, Muslims, immigrants and of course their most hated enemy, liberals.","post_message":"“This act is a direct assault on people’s right to freely worship,” local authorities say."},{"comment_id":"10152586371551135","commenter_b":"This is unacceptable. We need to stand up and love one another despite differences! Isis has definitely scared a lot of people. It would be nice if the Muslim community would make a statement in response to the killings around the world. Just to declare they are different of the terrorist and that what Isis has done is wrong. Then I think there would be a better understanding of Muslims. But even still there will remain evil people , like this man at Kroger. I'm constantly praying for our world. The world needs love. The world needs God. Blacks against whites. Whites against Arabs. Muslim against christian. Oh God help us all!!!!!","commenter_a":"Kelly Sleiman!!!!!","post_message":"Dearborn Police are investigating the beating of an Arab American man inside a local grocery store.
