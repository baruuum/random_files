However, law enforcement doesn't seem to agree. The Executive Director of the Fraternal Order of Police National Legislative Office, James Pasco, was quoted by the Washington Examiner as stating: \"Any ammunition is of concern to police in the wrong hands, but this specific round has historically not posed a law enforcement problem.\" FOP's website describes the organization as \"the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, with more than 325,000 members in more than 2,100 lodges.\" #M855"},{"comment_id":"1766493690288077","commenter_b":"get outta here!","commenter_a":"Democrats are so worried about Russia influencing our election by uncovering the truth.

As for the women \" that do were and are not interested\" in me- I couldn't care less, they are irrelevant. I have a beautiful wife. You are right in that everyone has physical preferences, I for one am not attracted to women with silicone breasts and/or mullets. Perhaps one day soon, when you hit the menopause, you might grow yourself a fine, full beard and be proud of it. All the best!","commenter_a":"If you can grow a beard, then why not? I really couldn't care less if someone finds my beard unsightly. You should be proud of your masculinity, not try and disguise it. I spend most of the daylight hours outside, the beard helps protects me from the elements and from those of a nervous disposition.","post_message":"Just one more reason to love beards!"},{"comment_id":"10152700132182434","commenter_b":"Also, can I state for the record Sansa had a good idea she would in fact have to have sex that night, but it's the only way to get her revenge on the boltons.
