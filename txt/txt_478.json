All so violent. All short of a few brain cells. Lmao you all get dumber and dumber ...","commenter_a":"This really exposes the mass ignorance in this country. The media brainwashed assses will stoop to any level. I remember when nobody hated Trump. Then the government owned media started a smear campaign. Wonder why the media would tell so many lies on one person. He's obviously a threat to the punks running things in this country.","post_message":"Because Donald Trump‚Äôs star continues to be vandalized, the Hollywood Historic Trust is considering removing it from the Hollywood Walk of Fame."},{"comment_id":"1106451702729020","commenter_b":"Go girls. Rape is never justified!","commenter_a":"It's sick that they were still trying to give excuses even though there is never an excuse for rape. Once that girl brought up raping 6 year olds they shut right up! They know it's not right but they're still trying to make up ways to say it's the women/girls' fault. This is so unacceptable and disheartening. üòî","post_message":"These teenage girls are confronting rape culture in India. This is what bravery looks like.

Unlike political girly men now. ENFORCE LAW and ORDER--GO TRUMP. Law and order will be immediately restored. Immediately Trump start Rounding up, deporting illegal swine criminals, illegal swine drug dealers, illegal swine drug cartel members.

Instigators to anti-police sentiment? Comments like Paul's are simply deniers to the findings of two separate independent investigations that produced identical findings. That is, Brown never had his hands up, was never surrendering and he was the aggressor.","post_message":"The Justice Department has finally confirmed what many of us were certain was the case: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told the truth about what happened when he said he shot Michael Brown in self-defense. After a six-month investigation, the DOJ concluded that Brown, allegedly a thug and a thief, was not trying to peacefully surrender when the incident occurred. He did not hold his hands up and say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot.‚Äù And he was not shot in the back, as some alleged. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"736534466449620","commenter_b":"RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST MURDERED THE 49 PEOPLE IN ORLANDO!! ...NOT GUNS!!
