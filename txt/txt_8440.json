Numb, mindless zombies.","post_message":"Another gift we can thank the feminists for. Let's see; the epidemic of single motherhood, the breakdown of the American family, the street vernacular of \"bitches and hos,\" the emasculation of men, defense of Islamic misogyny, suppression and oppression, silence on sharia, and the bone-crushing responsibility of one woman being mother, father, breadwinner, chief cook and bottle washer we owe to the feminists. And now this - one can only imagine what the likes of the Islamic State will do to our female soldiers."},{"comment_id":"10153662465839714","commenter_b":"Am I the only one who gets the joke?","commenter_a":"Mr trump, explain to me why something in the constitution is unconstitutional?","post_message":"Donald J.

BTW: find out where the largest number of historical artefacts from the middle east, coming with an unclear origin, are traded? Don't be surprised when you find out that it is London and you you can easily find out, that it is business of billionGBP earning. Why do you think IS is destroying historical sites? So, all this happens under the control of your government, right in your neighbourhood...","commenter_a":"The people were on their way and Germany take action to relief all surrounding countries, who where not able to cope with a minor percentage of the people floating their countries. Yes, it is not easy, but Germany helps a lot of people and countries and yes, it is a massive task, but we (you and me and our governments...) have to deal with it.Why? Because we are causing the situations, why the people have to flee and have seek for shelter. So, I am living in Hamburg, my borough is called \"Bahrenfeld\" and we have a polpulation 23.000 people. Currently we have 3.200 refugee living here. And I can hardly understand, why a country, which has caused and initilized a lot of the current wars in the middle east, in order to earn oil money ----NO---- to fight terrorism (hahaaa), refuses to take part in the resposibility...Yes, my dear ...","post_message":"â€œSometimes the smugglers arrive in the middle of the night and drop underage refugees off at the service station.
