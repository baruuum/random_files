He cleaned her clock and your whining butt just doesn't like it. If we lose this country it's because of idiots like you Beck!","post_message":"This was Donald Trumps best Performance in the debate. BUT remember the only goal is to ADD undecided voters. Charles Krauthammer just called Trumps performance Political Suicide. He is right. He was winning and then it began to break apart. They both have sealed their core long ago. Tonight was the last chance to bring the women that have been lost or questioning. Those Reagan democrats who worry about foreign policy, Russia or temperament. First 30 minutes were strong for him. He had some good lines and looked (at times) well informed. He had a great open borders section. While I cringed in the gun debate and abortion section. On the second Amendment Rubio, Cruz or almost any other candidate would have cleaned her clock when she spoke about 12 toddlers shooting people in DC. His pro choice response On partial birth abortion was the weakest I have ever heard. ..."},{"comment_id":"1875497529335937","commenter_b":"Ann Coulter is a very dumb idiot.

Big problem in our country is young girls are getting pregnant, guys leaving, single mom/hard to get education, etc ----> leads to broken family structures/children not raised properly---> leading to most problems we are facing in our country","commenter_a":"She didn't have sex, she had intercourse, or made love. Her sex is female. Why must we depersonalize coitus, to like farting or blowing your nose?? Let's put the LOVE back into making love, then our kids might make the connection to a loving act that sometimes leads to pregnancy. It's supposed to belong to people who are committed not a spectator sport or a recreational past time. :)","post_message":"She handled them pretty well though."},{"comment_id":"1183208918440780","commenter_b":"Stupid women. I'm one but Savannah is a regular person, comfortable in who she is. Why must she have makeup on after just having a baby. I'm not going to criticize her for that. Some people just don't know where their nose ends. Leave peoples' business alone. Who are you to make it your business?","commenter_a":"Seriously? People care whether or not she's wearing makeup?
