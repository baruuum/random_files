Women may become dependent on prescription painkillers more quickly than men. Women may be more likely than men to engage in ‚Äúdoctor shopping‚Äù (obtaining prescriptions from multiple prescribers). Abuse of prescription painkillers by pregnant women can put an infant at risk. Cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)‚Äîwhich is a group of problems that can occur in newborns exposed to prescription painkillers or other drugs while in the womb‚Äîgrew by almost 300% in the US between 2000 and 2009. ---@webpagelink","commenter_a":"These addictions for many were not choices but had a slow way of happening. Many were prescribed pain relieving drugs after surgery or have a bad back or another painful injury and the doctors wrote prescriptions for opioid medicine like the were going out of style. The family that owes the company that make Oxy, are literally billionaires now just by selling Oxycontin. When you write millions of prescriptions for Oxy in less than 20 years, what the hell do you think that will happen? Many of those people become addicts if you take these drugs for a long enough time. When the doctors stop writing scrips, the people turn to any source available. IMO, Doctors are responsible for the current heroin epidemic in this state and country.","post_message":"‚ÄúIt focuses on a social service intervention as opposed to criminal justice intervention, and it‚Äôs been very successful in Seattle,‚Äù Portland Mayor Michael Brennan, who is a licensed clinical social worker, said."},{"comment_id":"836801636436616","commenter_b":"Any one doing this should be around up put in jail and when it is time to get out they should be deported","commenter_a":"And those BASTARDS in DC want to bring in over @username in the next two years.

So I don't think you can rape a spider. If they were to take off the harmless pins, it would find a corner and immediately start building a web, because it's a spider and it has no conscience. The closest I can relate to this spider is giving blood.","commenter_a":"Wow.

They are human and most are probably good people fleeing a civil war. No need to be sent to the United States.","post_message":"\"There is no reason America cannot create a safe zone for these refugees in the Middle East. That is the most compassionate thing to do for them. It is the safest thing to do for America.
