Original post: New York police are looking for five men who forced a father at gunpoint to leave his teen daughter behind so they could take turns raping her, authorities say. The 18-year-old was with her father at the Osborn Playground in Brooklyn around 9 p.m. Thursday when the brutal gang rape took place, according to NYPD. Authorities released this grainy surveillance video, taken in a bodega before the violent assault, that they say shows the suspected attackers. Police are asking for the public's assistance in identifying them.
