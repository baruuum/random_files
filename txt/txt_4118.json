But doggier....she \"kept\" you. She got you back. By completely NOT ANYTHING like what you thought you married. She's an evil, money-hungry, evil, liar, in a position in government she shouldn't even be a janitor that empties her garbage can, ugly (well, she's always been ugly) and a moral-less female. So I guess it does end up how it should be in the end. She should sit in jail the rest of her life. You two are the epitome if what a marriage should not ever be. And you sound proud! You're both despicable.","commenter_a":"Terri Bock","post_message":"\"I married my best friend.
