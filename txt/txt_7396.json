My family and I aren't afraid because they did it the right way when coming over, they obeyed the law! No matter what ones last name is we are all immigrants, but there is a difference between immigrants and illegal immigrants. So sad that many people people don't realize the difference like yourself.","commenter_a":"What part do you all not understand or haven't read??? She entered the United States illegally November 2015!!!! Judge ordered her out of the US on January 26th. She broke the law!!! Yes it's sad that she MAY have a brain tumor but even the doctors have said they aren't for sure that it's cancerous. Doctors have cleared her medically to be discharged from the hospital in a stable condition! She had a medical episode on February 11th but once again got discharged from the hospital! So what makes this case \"non humane\" that you all speak of?!?!? She has broken the law, she has gotten medical help and was released from a medical team outside the detention center. Nothing inhumane going on!","post_message":"An undocumented 26-year-old woman from El Salvador who has a brain tumor was moved from a hospital to an ICE detention center in Texas."},{"comment_id":"985293351528112","commenter_b":"Well the high taxes on import/exported goods and labor, access fees to our harbors and Panama Canal or fees to get visas will sure help to pay for wall.
