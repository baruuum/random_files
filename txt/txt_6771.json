He is not our best choice he's our worst choice. He's a frigging liberal that is in the election to help Hillary get in why can't people see that!!'","post_message":"WATCH Ben Ferguson on why he's endorsing our campaign.

They are a whole level of crazy I don't want to be around. Scary! I didn't see riots like this when Obama was elected-because we have class and integrity. Trump will lead this country like no other! I can't wait for the future of America!🇺🇸🚂❤️","commenter_a":"Our country is full of spoiled people who are so used to having things their way, they act like a class of 5 y/o kids who didn't get the green marker! Come on, this country has the same electoral system that has worked without problem for hundreds if years. No one rioted when any other person has been elected, altjpugh i am sure many people felt disappointment. And the democrats and supporters whole campaign slogan was \"stronger together, peace, love, equality\"......... Which all I'm seeing is a true fit being thrown by people who didn't get their way. Funny how true colors come shining out when the world they are used to getting their way in doesn't quite work out. Peace, love, equality, anti hate??? I think not supporters. Your example is clear.","post_message":"Protesters burned American flags and chanted \"not my president\" despite Democrats' calls for a peaceful transition of power."},{"comment_id":"1561423844160413","commenter_b":"@username 😜","commenter_a":"@username me","post_message":"One 38-year-old Liverpool man took 39 goes to pass. 🚙"},{"comment_id":"10152727264626051","commenter_b":"This woman is sick, she needs to lose her own child and put into intense therapy with jail time.","commenter_a":"Gross!!!!!!","post_message":"This kid never really thought about why his mom was so excited when his 11-year-old friend came over.
