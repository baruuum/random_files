Furthermore , what satan's secretary calls the \"extreme\" position of Republican candidates on women's health is really a quite normal position for any one who wants to protect a babies life and quite possibly the life of the mother as well. Of course that position endangers the finances of planned parenthood so naturally Ms. Richards , who would lose her lucrative job if abortion is outlawed, wants to help elect someone who favors her cause. May God have mercy on Clinton, Richards and all like them who promote the culture of death.(MA)","post_message":"The endorsement marks the first time Planned Parenthood has waded into a presidential primary."},{"comment_id":"10152932184944753","commenter_b":"BTW wasn't she on her way to see her Bf why not just let him pay for a cab instead of letting her ride on the subway while she's drunk and tired from all of the dancing in the party.
