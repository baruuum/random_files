The plan was for 1200, but we have 1900. This summer, I drove to the UK. The British press reported trouble and riots in Calais and Dover - we sailed through, in both directions. Germany has taken 8x the number of refugees than Britain. And, incidently, I find that if I post here, I often receive an extremely rude and aggressive reply from someone in the UK. I find the British to be quite aggressive, probably frustration with the pro military, right wing, Banker Government, for whom they voted.
