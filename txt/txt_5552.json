Wind turbines kill birds? A far less amount then any oil spill I have seen. Or pipeline that explodes. We could do this all day but this country is long past the need to go clean energy. I hope you idiots are paid to post all these ridiculous comments.","commenter_a":"Wind and solar don't make any sense, you have to cut down large areas of forest's to put up windmills on mountain tops to construct them, and they end up killing many birds. Same goes for solar, you would have to blanket the continental US with solar panels to replace fossil fuels. It's got nothing to do with \"evil big business\", wind and solar will just never be as efficient and reliable as coal, oil, and natural gas.","post_message":"A natural gas plant in Lycoming County is now complete, and it provides energy to nearly 1 million families in our area and other parts of the northeast."},{"comment_id":"957758620983859","commenter_b":"I don't mean to sound rude on the subject but I'm soooo tired of women having kids (multiple times) and complaining about life is so hard for them.
