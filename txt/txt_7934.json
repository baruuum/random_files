Are the kids wrong for what they did? Yes! Should they be punished for what they did? Yes! No one who made any of these comments could be their parents I'm sure or you wouldn't be saying such hate filled things. No one is going to win in situations like this, I pray all the families and businesses can come back from this, I pray something can be salvaged somewhere. And I pray everyone who has hate in their hearts can change. This world would be a much better place if people loved like they are supposed to, to much greed and hate now. How would any of you feel if they were your family members or if you lost someone. I'm sure some of you are christians?? Think about what you could do for someone instead of spreading hatred and negativity!","post_message":"JUST IN: 2 juveniles have been charged with starting the Tennessee wildfire that killed 14 people."},{"comment_id":"1289522947781268","commenter_b":"Spoiled racist brat","commenter_a":"Michelle Obama is the most bitter, most racist First Lady in recent history.","post_message":"First lady Michelle Obama implied this week that many Americans no longer have hope because of Donald Trump's victory.

The police might have something on him and if they have he should be charged and locked up for life. And all the tax payers money your going on about let Cliff Richard pay for it if he's guilty, let the police seize all he's wealth and money and all go in police funds.

In an American city, thousands and thousands of children have been drinking and bathing in poisonous water for more than a year. It was not an unavoidable natural disaster. It is a man-made catastrophe. Now, thousands of children are at risk of lifelong damage from lead exposure – unless we help get them the care, attention and resources they need. We have a responsibility to help the people of Flint tell their story – and to be sure that story is heard loud and clear in the halls of Congress. The story of Flint challenges the conscience of America. It holds lessons and warnings for communities across the country."},{"comment_id":"10154014053348984","commenter_b":"SHES A RACIST BIGOT ANYWAY","commenter_a":"I don't know anyone that likes that show, or doesn't think that Whoopie is whoopie.","post_message":"Donald J.
