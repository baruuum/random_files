These folks belong in Wapato and Wapato needs to be converted into a mental health care site.. They commit crimes against society -- leaving garbage around is just a visible symptom but when folks aren't looking, they misbehave in more destructive ways. They need to be 'rebooted,' in the computer sense, not the kick-in-the-pants sense. Though some of them need that as well...","post_message":"Mayor Hales said today was the first of several in which the homeless will be moved out of city parks."}]
