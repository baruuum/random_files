When reason and logic doesn't work, you know the NRA propaganda has got a serious grip on us. We've shown the world how much our armed gun citizenry has worked - America's mass shootings are on a continuous news cycle being aired around the world. They must think we are arrogant when we refuse to look at their own country's statics as proof that less guns indeed do work. It's so logical, so reasonable, less guns, less gun related deaths.
