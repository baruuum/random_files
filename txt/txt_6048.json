The point Mrs. Trump is making is that these spoiled American young adults have ZERO idea of what hard work is. They want to live the life they see on TV but don't understand that you need to work for it, hard. The jobs that these spoiled kids don't want will get filled by immigrants.","commenter_a":"It's easy to get angry about that statement. Seems inflammatory and unreasonable right? But consider this.....we have a generation of dummies who are demanding $15 an hour to flip burgers, wash cars, and other mindless entry level jobs. When these boneheads get what they ask for, and are replaced by technology, what's left? The mopping and sweeping jobs. They already think they're too good for those jobs now, so who do you think takes the jobs? The immigrants. Put the PC sensitivity away and face facts. The spoiled, entitled, millennial cry babies created this. Let them wallow in it. @username Robby Gould","post_message":"Donald J.
