Democrats weren't for gay and lesbian or transgender rights until Hillary needed more votes. Last election Hillary ran in, she is on video saying marriage is between a man and woman. She flip flopped and so did the party for more votes.","post_message":"Hey, Leftists: you want to stand up for LGBT folks? How about joining conservatives in speaking forcefully and honestly about the MURDER of gays and lesbians by MUSLIM terrorists inflicting SHARIA LAW?  Oh...that's right, Obama doesn't allow you to talk about that. So instead you 'boldly' focus on men using women's changing rooms and bathrooms and ignore the DEATHS of hundreds of gays and lesbians, because identifying their killers would require you to utter the words 'Islamic terrorists.'  Gee, how 'noble' of you, how 'brave.'  #phonies #poseurs"},{"comment_id":"1589593461282497","commenter_b":"What a dork...........","commenter_a":"This guy is putting himself in the same catagory as Trump when he talks this way about anyone.

You don't want to make a man commit, so men sleep with you and then drop you when they want. They don't have to commit or treat you right because they can go find some other chick not interested in holding a man down, fuck her then leave again.

I believe ini just telling it like it is.","commenter_a":"Have any of you followed Naomi Wolf's facebook page? I have for the past couple of years. She's an anti-Israel bigot, and she ignores women's issues whenever they involved Islam. I called her out on it many times.

Only difference is she's a criminal and she'll be far worse for this country because she'll have to prove a point soley because she's a woman.
