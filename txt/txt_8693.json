You don't reward bad behavior. Companies don't have certain people to service certain customers!!!

The difference between Russia and the USA is that the USA never asked for permission to invade any country. They just did what they wanted, and they destroyed the whole country with it's sovereignty. Another difference is - when you sea how these leaders greet \"dictators\" as they call them, with extremely wide hypocritical smile, and after a while the destroy them.
