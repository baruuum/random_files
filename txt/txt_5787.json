We were given a packet with what was okay to wear and what wasn't. The dress code is established before you even start working, so I don't really see the problem with them sending her home.","post_message":"This woman says she was sent home for wearing these shorts to work -- which she purchased in the store's career style section."},{"comment_id":"1082992428420186","commenter_b":"She will never be in jail","commenter_a":"How can she send people to jail from her prison cell?","post_message":"Dangerous person!"},{"comment_id":"10153823295824411","commenter_b":"You needed to be pulled over Obama.","commenter_a":"He got racially profiled into being elected president.","post_message":" as a report that came out just this week reminded us, there are a lot of African-Americans, not just me, who have that same kind of story of being pulled over or frisked or something, and the data shows that this is not an aberration."},{"comment_id":"1118814734807982","commenter_b":"174742062548592helle Tenney let it first be understood I can care less for evil feminist. My point is why go to a frat house that is known for Alcohol drugs and loose women having sex up stairs, when you know inappropriate things always happen in places like that. Secondly, I'm sure she was there drinking in an unsafe environment but I don't condone anyone being raped but we should ask ourselves why the Hell do women keep going to places that are historically unsafe for women? Lastly, women lie so much about rape and other things that no one knows when they are telling the truth. There has been several times when men have been falsely accused of rape and we found out later that she was just trying to cover up the fact that she decided to sleep with the whole football team at once. I see the police reports ...","commenter_a":"Ok but why was she even there in the first place?!!!!!!
