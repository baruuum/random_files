Oh, but you have Christians like the Duggars fighting for you. Good luck with that. I'll pray that you elect pedophiles so you can pray away the sin and let the criminals walk around molesting new victims. Jesus forgives. but society should prosecute crimes.

That means more than just picnics and sales and the start of summer.  It‚Äôs a time to offer tribute, prayers and thanks to the heroic men and women of America‚Äôs military who for over two centuries have laid down their lives to protect our freedoms.    But we should also remember the many wounded warriors who survived the battles, but came home with deep and lasting scars.  They deserve the very best care we can give them.  Not only through the Veterans Administration, but through private aid groups, like K9s For Warriors.  It‚Äôs a non-profit group that provides service dogs to vets with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities, to help them return to civilian life with independence and dignity.  100 percent of individual donations go to the program.  And 95 percent of the service dogs they train are rescued from shelters.  So when you donate to them, you don‚Äôt just help a veteran, you save a dog, too. Talk about doubling your money!  To learn more, go online to K9sForWarriors.org."},{"comment_id":"10153655061641336","commenter_b":"There not illegal immigrants, they are Illegal Aliens.

It dates back to at best sometime in the late 70s/early 80s. I remember a girl in my youth group had brought one of her Mormon friends one summer's eve, and I got into a conversation with her and I'll remember what she said til the day I die- 'I'm not a Christian, I'm a Mormon!' That would have been 74 or 75. Also, the concept that 'As God was, so man is; as God is so man may become' is utterly missing from the other thee Abrahamic faiths.","commenter_a":"Um, no.
