The ACLU would rather cast legal immigrants in with the illegal Alien filth than make a distinction between legal immigrants and these animals. It's not \"harsh\", it's calling this scum exactly what they are.","commenter_a":"Hey ACLU, these animals aren't \"undocumented immigrants\", don't lump this filth in with those that have legally immigrated here. They are Illegal Aliens, not legal permanent residences, naturalized citizens or here on visas. They broke the law and should be treated like the criminals they are; detained, processed and then deported back to their home countries along with their families. This garbage SHOULD live in fear, be harassed and made to feel uncomfortable. They should be detained, when local LEO interact with them, and then turned over to ICE/CBP for deportation.","post_message":"Since Election Day, the ACLU has seen a renewed sense of urgency from hundreds of thousands of Americans to protect civil liberties. One of our top priorities is ensuring that our communities donâ€™t fall under siege in service of Trumpâ€™s quest to deport undocumented immigrants. To carry out his mass deportation scheme, Trump would have to cast his dragnet far deeper into American communities. Even if massive taxpayer dollars could be diverted to do so as a practical matter, the effort will erode the civil liberties of all. Millions of people who live and work along our nation's bordersâ€”from New York to Arizona, Washington State to Texasâ€”are already living in increasingly militarized areas where they are stopped, harassed and treated in ways the U.S. Constitution does not permit.
