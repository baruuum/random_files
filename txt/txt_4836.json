Words, that's right, he has a short vocabulary. He can't say it's going to be great, really, really, great. When I tell you, it's going to be yuge.

The women in most offices I've worked at wore sleeveless dresses and tops that were tasteful and appropriate. Even the women news anchors wear tasteful sleeveless outfits. I don't see a problem with that. I do however agree a dress code should be in place for kids in school. When they get out in the real world, there are rules, and they have to be followed. 48-50 years ago, we had to wear skirts or dresses that touched the floor if kneeled down.

If they didn't have a belt, they had to pay 50 cents for a piece of masking tape with the word belt on it and tape it to their pants, and they better have ...","commenter_a":"I say all schools should have a dress code and make sure all students adhere to it.
