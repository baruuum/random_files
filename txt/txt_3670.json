Bahahaha bitch please...you are obviously no intellectual titan","commenter_a":"Though at least as far as the so-called \"New Atheists\" go Dawkins - along with Daniel Dennett - actually has substance to what he says and knows how to contextualise his arguments (some of the time). Christopher Hitchens sounded like an intellectual but acted like a thug. And Sam Harris is frankly one of the most pathetic and risible writers to garner an otherwise intelligent audience in this century so far. Ego the size of a planet - with a humourless sense of his own importance despite the impotence and unoriginality of his work - without even the charisma of Hitchens or the intellect of Dawkins/Dennett to back it up.","post_message":"“How dare you force your dopey unsubstantiated superstitions on innocent children too young to resist?

New grew up in San Francisco, California, became an excellent student, and dreamed of becoming a doctor. A month after New graduated from Cal-Berkeley with honors, a 3.7 grade point average, and a major in Molecular and Cellular Biology, President Obama established the DACA program.
