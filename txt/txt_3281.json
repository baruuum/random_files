It seems Jihadi Jane neither understands how her actions are viewed by the enemy (major Muslim oil exporters, some of whose core members want to see the destruction of the United States) nor how these anti-jobs protests impact hundreds of thousands of North American families. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154141762806162","commenter_b":"Wild animals!!!!! trump is the wild animal causing all this bs PIED PIPER !!!","commenter_a":"People need to stop blaming Trump for the actions of low life people.
