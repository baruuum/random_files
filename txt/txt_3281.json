Her evil intentions are based upon her greedy lust for power and money. But with all due respect, Mr. Trump, what I find so incredibly \"shocking\" is that NO ONE CARES ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT HER!!! Everyone is pissing and moaning ALL THE TIME about Hillary and Obama, saying she done this, and Obama done that. BUT WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THEIR REIGN OF TERROR? NOTHING. ZERO. ZILCH. NADA. To me that says that Americans are a bunch of APATHETIC ENABLERS. We the people deserve the lot we've been given because we, as a nation, have ALLOWED IT!!! #stoptheenabling #stopthetyranny #votetrump","commenter_a":"\"Because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death.\" -Hillary Clinton, 8-25-16 We know that's true, Hillary. We know that's true. Signed: Ambassador Stevens Sean Smith Glen Doherty Tyrone Woods","post_message":"Hillary Clintonâ€™s actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise - she created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings. She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didnâ€™t care â€“ as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great. Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public. As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of ..."},{"comment_id":"1369422333077793","commenter_b":"Witch Hillary and hubby slick Willie..","commenter_a":"#Trumphasmyvote","post_message":"Is there any stopping Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

I simply illustrate that women must figure out exactly what it is they want before complaining about how things are. I purposely let the door close on a woman because I don't always hold it for a guy. Women give me a stink face so often and I tell them it's me treating them equally. Have a woman pay for her own dinner once and see how far you get to having a second date. ... List goes on and on","commenter_a":"I've been to the Middle East. There isn't an American woman alive that can talk to me about oppression by men. Women run this country. They are the reason men wake up in the morning. I feel women in this country have an identity crisis in that they want chilvary but in the same instance they want equality. Men are tough and ravenous towards each other. You want that then don't complain when men treat you as they would a fellow man. (I want to add this doesn't apply to ALL women just the ones it does)","post_message":"Much of what we hear about the plight of American women is false."}]
