They’ve been much too eager to use that gun—we’ve seen it with policing and we’ve seen it with civilians. With police, first and foremost, they need to be trained and held accountable and disciplined in a way that prevents the reaction that we’ve seen way too much of. And with civilians—a lot of these “stand your ground” laws need to be rewritten. If you have to defend yourself, OK. But look at some of the instances we’ve had—Trayvon Martin, and too many more. Nobody should want to create circumstances in which innocent, unarmed people are killed—either by law enforcement or by civilians wielding guns. We’ve got to figure out how to deal with that."},{"comment_id":"10153380386696130","commenter_b":"No, illegal immigrants do not commit 35% of murders in this county.
