Uneducated people who have no idea about current events would have no idea.

Also total set up to prove a point that we choose at the moment what we're going to have a hissy fit about and how worse things could totally go under the radar because of the uneducated and ignorant people out there. I guarantee you most people couldn't recognize 3 out of any of the 50 state flags and I'm being generous with that!
