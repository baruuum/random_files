Mexico has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world that are controlled by some of the most deadliest drug cartels. Mexico is losing billions in tourism because of the Cartel. Mexico is a culturally rich country that is being destroyed by these drug cartels. By building this wall it will help both the Mexican and the American economies by stopping drug trade. The Cartels will lose many because supply will be cut of and Mexico will gain strength. 95% of illegal drugs that come across the border will be stopped by a wall. It will in turn save our communities and our youth. Our youth will be able to flourish instead of turning to drugs.

A genetically male transgender would (quite correctly) not be allowed to compete in a woman's race whereas a genetically female transgender would only get beaten were she to compete in a male race. Caster is (it seems) totally different.

If she has Y chromosomes then she isn't qualified to compete in female races but, as with female transgenders, there is little point in her trying (and she should not with two X chromosomes) to compete in male races.","post_message":"South African runner Caster Semenya dominated the women's 800-meter final Saturday in Rio, finishing well ahead of the competition to take home the gold medal.
