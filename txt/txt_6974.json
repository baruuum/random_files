Why is one suddenly more shocking than another? There's probably at least one lesbian I a crowded changing room and there's a good chance that the transgender woman prefers men. I understand being on guard I do. But not why a bit of dangling body parts suddenly makes that person mortifying to be seen by.","commenter_a":"Ok, I'm sure I will be shot down for this. Firstly, I don't think anyone likes communal changing areas, certainly not anyone I've ever met. I don't think the general issue with this is because you are transgender, although that puts a different slant on it. I don't think many people are happy getting their wobbly bits (of whatever kind!) out in front of strangers in a changing room.

Seriously stop! If you want to live some backwards, 1950s lifestyle, you go right ahead. While you're at it, why don't you just keep your opinions to yourself, since that's what a nice housewife would do, right? Give me a break. This misogynist refused to give her a break. There is also nothing to be modest about when it comes to breast feeding or pumping.
