That \"plain red cup\" represents the disdain that Starbucks and its homosexual CEO have for Conservative and Christian values.

You acknowledge that there can be different factions on the left but not right apparently as well. If your main concern is the debt then you should lean more conservative as the primary goal is financial stability. Bush was not a conservative btw, he was more liberal. The main difference in policy between Obama and Bush (and possibly both parties in general atm) is \"what\" they wanted to spend money on but they both want to spend as much as they can get away with. I also do not accept your copy and pasted answer to Octavio's question. A definition doesn't tell anything. He's asking where you see the differences. It's also dishonest to call America ...","commenter_a":"Socialism works, as designed by the Founding Fathers, all of whom were socialists.","post_message":"Republican liar: 1 Bill Maher: Infinity"},{"comment_id":"1171597936185008","commenter_b":"Says the white woman.
