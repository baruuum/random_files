The radicals /terrorist r the strikers. The extremists r the midfielders who feed the radicals. The defenders r the moderate Muslims who create diversions, deflect, defend and save Islam from legitimate criticisms n any accusations. They work as a team though they create the perception that the defenders have nothing to do with the strikers. The Liberals r the goalies who jump in when the situation gets worse with statements like Islam is a religion of peace @ De Joe Int'l ur comment had to be repeated.","post_message":"'We march through the night to cut and behead...

Repealing the 17th Amendment would take the money out of Senate elections on the federal level. Senators would be beholden to their state legislatures again rather than the corporatist class that lines their pockets, finances their re-election campaigns and ensures them seven-figure lobbying gigs once their time in “public service” ends. Senators would not act against their states, as 12 senators from 10 states are currently doing in regard to President Barack Obama’s executive action on amnesty for illegals. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10155084473033984","commenter_b":"@username yes you are.... it's never enough for you people never enough","commenter_a":"Okay, this is absolutely disgusting and I am appalled by the behavior of these CRIMINALS, but I did not see this much coverage or outrage when those WHITE teen males abused then raped the black handicapped teen with a metal hanger, causing permanent damage to him internally... they were let off the hook by the way. Charges dropped... media barely covered it and there were even people who made jokes about it or defended the white teens... so next time one of you white people wants to cry how white privilege is not real or how the media ignores black on white crimes, think again. These black teens are getting the punishment they deserve while the white teens (that did worse as they caused physically permanent damage) are out and about, as if nothing happened. DISGUSTING","post_message":"This is just sickening and heartbreaking at the same time. We just found out 1 key fact about the relationship between the disabled teen and one of his torturers... and it's absolutely shocking.
