Couldn'tget them to bring single payer to the floor.","commenter_a":"The reason we spend the most with the worst outcomes is because we save people who wouldn't have ever had a chance elsewhere in the world. Our 911 system is a model for the global community and have a lots of saves who would've died elsewhere. The people that we save and live often go on to live on ventilators and long term care.

I want my President to have clarity of thought, to speak in a measured, thoughtful and highly educated tone. I don't want her or his words to be subject to interpretation. His rhetoric is inflammatory, bigoted, and often without thought. His use of language is at best that of an arrogant, whiny, teen-ager. No way does this man possess the skill-sets needed to be my president.","post_message":"There have been multiple explanations. There haven't yet been any that work."}]
