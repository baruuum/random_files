Last night AP declared Hillary Clinton had garnered enough delegates -- by way of super delegates -- to secure the Democrat nomination for president. Everyone is expressing how this is a great historic moment. I agree, it is a historic moment. The new American Socialist Party, once known as the Democrat Party, now has a sitting president and a nominee for president who abandoned Americans to die and lied about it. And to all the detractors who would dismiss this, just think about the mother of Sean Smith widow and orphaned child of Tyrone Woods.and the families of Ambassador Chris Stevens and Glen Doherty. This is not a historic moment for them. It is an indictment of how America rewards the most despicable and abhorrent behavior.

Do you think the candidate who gets the most votes should win?"}]
