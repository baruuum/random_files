I would also like to know how to find out who in Congress reported for work when Congress was in session. I would like to know the Congressional schedule, pay, vacation time, healthcare benefits including what company handles their care. I would like to know of any other benefits they receive, as an example- I believe there is a gym in the Congressional building. These are the questions I want answered. Please direct me to the places I can find these answers. Thank you and your team for the hard work and excellent reporting all year.

God created us ALL but the murderer was not created that way just as Homosexual was not either...a sin is a sin. The BIBLE is very clear in this. Sin is delighful & addictive & we tend to consume ourself in our sins hence why it's hard to detour ourself from sin...that's why we NEED Jesus Christ in our hearts. Jesus Christ was tempted in the dessert with everything you can think of yet he continued to tell Satan no & to flee. When Jesus was thirsty & hungry in the dessert & Satan tempted him with food & water He still said no. We have to do the same with temptation/sin. There is ALWAYS a way out of sin if we put ALL our faith/hope/strenth in Jesus Christ He will ...","post_message":"Trey Pearson, Christian Rock Star, Comes Out As Gay.
