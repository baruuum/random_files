People are coming over our boarders. Like or not, they are here. We can do three things at this point. We can continue the way we are. We can make a path to citizenship easier and less likely they're going to be expelled if they try. Or we can get all crazy and build a Great Wall around our boarders. Illegal citizenship builds poverty. Poverty creates crime. We all know this. I must remind you that precious few of us are truly Native Americans.","commenter_a":"People just don't understand how much America depends on Immigrant labor. If they were all to go on strike we'd all be paying more for things we take for granted.
