They want to raise the gas tax, they want to introduce a milage tax. Who will this hurt the most? The pood and middle class. The Democrats don't care about the poor and middle class, they view them as cannon fodder.

That is not a coincidence at all. We taxpayers, the People, are paying for the subjugation and torment of a large portion of our population. Mostly a minority inmate population, I might add. It's just wrong no matter how you look at it.","post_message":"The U.S. has more people in jail than any other country on earth.
