Edward Garcia was convicted of murder Tuesday in the torture and dismemberment death of Herbert Tracy White.  Prosecutors say Garcia carved up White's body with a 3 1/2-inch blade and dissected and sliced a piece of leg muscle from the bone.  Hotel employees found White's severed arms and a backpack full of flesh in the room. Under the blood-soaked bed was White's torso riddled with scratches and small punctures.  'It was a bloodbath,' prosecutor John McKinney said. 'They took this man apart.'
