Abortion is a legal medical procedure. Women don't need your approval, your acceptance, or your opinion. Do you expect women you've never met to weigh in on your private medical decisions? Of course not! Stop being so arrogant. What isn't acceptable is your flawed thinking that you can control a woman. You can only control yourself.","commenter_a":"\"Birth control\" is a misnomer. If one thinks about it, it signifies controlling an already conceived being. Therefore, i do not embrace birth control. Like stopping birth.
