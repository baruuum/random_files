Hypocrites..."},{"comment_id":"10154350184251336","commenter_b":"She won the nomination because of Super delegates like Nancy Pelosi. Should have done in on pledged delegates only. The AP announcing her win the day before the final primaries didn't help, but that was her plan all along. How many Sanders supporters stayed home and didn't vote because of that well planned news flash. This woman will do ANYTHING to get her way.

To correct their unintended consequence, what will liberals recommend? They will recommend coercing the college into providing the students with birth control...
