No questions just stomp them and dump them back across the border.","commenter_a":"She just deserve a raspberry. It is the to be said to her. Our immigration system needs work but she is really talking about letting illegal aliens in. The term illegal means we have acknowledged that they have committed a non-legal act, thus becoming a criminal. That means do not pass Go do not collect 200 dollars. They are already being coddled at our expense. If, they are caught they should be taken direct to be fingerprinted and photographed, then directly to a border. If, they are identified as having done it before. We should setup a location far away to ship them to. This non-American needs to mind her own business, instead of trying to shovel her troubles on to us.","post_message":"Oh really?"},{"comment_id":"739879102780921","commenter_b":"She's biding her time!!!","commenter_a":"Let me offer you, @username, some unsolicited and unqualified advice since I'm not a politician. There is no way you should be neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. But you're playing weak. Go on the attack. Use your willingness to stay in a marriage regardless of your husband's infidelity as a selling point. We all know people make mistakes. Marriages often dissolve over a hint of unfaithfulness and unforgiveness. Only the extremely strong can take a mistake made by a spouse to demonstrate their character. If I'm not mistaken this is Sanders' second wife and 'The Donald' has had three wives and several affairs. How many times have you been married? They can't use President Bill Clinton's infidelity to their advantage, but you can. Who are the people advising you?","post_message":"Jimmy Fallon: Can we do a Snapchat?
