Hope they sterile her so she can't bring anymore babies into this world for her husband","commenter_a":"Your husband should be on death row, and never see the light of day. To murder an innocent baby shows the cowardice and evil in his heart. He can't be allowed to live...he's a threat to society. One question...how can you defend his actions? He MURDERED your BABY...absolutely disgusting, both of you.","post_message":"This woman's husband was fed up with his son crying so he hit him so hard that it killed him.

That was when she lost her bar license for being both unethical and lying.","commenter_a":"Frankly, the Obama presidency, with all its scandals/crimes, has set incredible legal precedence for defendants to get away with almost anything, from lying, to destroying evidence, to treason, to tax evasion, you name it. Now, anyone accused of anything can simply demand equal protection and have their attorneys cite any one or all of the Obama Defenses.","post_message":"*** UPDATE *** This was a very big week for us, with tremendous results!
