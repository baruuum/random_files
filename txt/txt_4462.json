She just encourages them to get abortions so they can go back to their life and most likely get pregnant again.","commenter_a":"So here's an actual SOLUTION for all the pro-life people... Rather then protest, why don't you offer to help those poor, confused girls seeking an abortion? Perhaps these women feel they have no other option.

Also when it comes to caring for people with a large organization things are much more complicated . There are many people who max out on pain killers and still feel pain in the hospitals. So when it comes to pain meds that are very valuable and they may not work why administer them ? In places like Calcutta it is not just a question of money but also transportation .
