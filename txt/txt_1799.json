All illegals should be made uncomfortable by cops and regular citizens alike.","commenter_a":"and again until you've walked in a cops shoes you don't know what it's like!

I'm Sick and tired of orople picking on the cops. Yes I'm sure there are some that aren't the best but most of the cops are good. Start celebrating the good cops for a change!!

He won because People are tired of the false unemployment rate Obama is pushing. Tired of the rising cost of Insurance except for people like you who probably get it for free. Tired of the war with radical Islam that he has no strategy for winning. Tired of illegal aliens pushed on us and tired of sanctuary cities and tired of people like Kate Steinle being murdered by them. You certainly can't blame Trump for any of those things. Have a nice day in your la-la land world.","commenter_a":"Actually, Barack Obama is responsible for Trumps win because he has screwed this country so badly and people are sick of his shit and knew that Killary is not only unqualified, dishonest as hell, and a total liar but that she would continue Obamas agenda to destroy our country.","post_message":"Barack Obama said that Russia is responsible for Donald J. Trump's win, but he didn't expect Sean Hannity to knock his lies right back in his face. The democrats just got schooled.
