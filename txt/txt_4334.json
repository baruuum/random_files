The Mexican President Enrique Pe Nieto could do something to help make their country better so the Mexican people would want to stay in their own country. I am sure he doesn't mind allowing the criminals to come here and apparently he doesn't care about the poor either, but something has to be done to protect our America.","commenter_a":"I loved it.
