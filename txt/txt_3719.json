With that being said, we the people must find a way to be heard and stop any deal with Iran. Our congress can't let one man with no foreign policy skills, put the world in danger. Everyone knows that Iran can't be trusted and after the Bergdahl disaster, can we trust Obama.","post_message":"The U.S. is considering letting Iran run hundreds of centrifuges at a once-secret bunker in exchange for limits on centrifuge work and research and development at other sites."},{"comment_id":"975822185786810","commenter_b":"@username...I never have been a democrate I'm an independent.
