This is America and a lot of us are Christians and we don't need or want immigrants telling us to change our beliefs. If you don't like our beliefs and our freedoms, maybe you should g o back to you country and try to get along. If you choose to stay here and enjoy our life and freedoms, then stop telling us to give up.our beliefs. I suggest you join a branch of service and share the responsibility of living here instead of holding your hands out for every thing you can get for free.

How about criticizing him where it's actually warranted instead of focusing on this nonsense?","post_message":"Bernie Sanders claims to be the champion of low-wage workers across America. However, what he did to a waiter recently proves that the rumpled, curmudgeonly socialist is full of hot air.  None of the GOP field would have EVER done this... not even Christie.

She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didnâ€™t care â€“ as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.  Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.  As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.  What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history."},{"comment_id":"650948841696821","commenter_b":"Yup","commenter_a":"@username smh crazy sheeeet","post_message":"Damn."}]
