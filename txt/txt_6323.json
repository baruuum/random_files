Healthcare is not a right, it is something acquired by honest toil, and it is NOT something everyone needs, shown by the IRS' discovery that people are paying the stupid tax penalty rather than buy something the government is telling them to buy but which they DON'T need. \"People should not be dying in the US because they're sick.\" They're not, Bernie. It's a myth from the ideology of myths you refuse to see have no basis in truth. @webpagelink","post_message":"â€œWe are the only major country on earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right, and I think we should change that,\" Bernie Sanders said."}]
