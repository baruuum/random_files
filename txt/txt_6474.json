She hasn't spoken to him for a reason. Probably the same reason why Lisa Bonet and God knows how many other members from the cast have not!

Can only hope!!","post_message":"It is outrageous that some would aim to divide a community over a banner that has been proudly displayed since Sept. 11, 2001. I commend the Pittsburg community for rejecting this decision and I stand with them. The Constitution guarantees a right to freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. This banner is not only an expression of faith, but of love for country. Expressions of patriotism, faith, and community should be welcome in our society and I have contacted USPS officials to express my concerns about their decision and to request their reconsideration. If the local post office branch is unwilling to display the banner, then I would be proud to hang it at my own office in Pittsburg."},{"comment_id":"10152960759722377","commenter_b":"this traitor could add votes from the foreign countries that paid her bribe money to her and bills family charity, like she will add the illegals vote here in the US when the election rolls around","commenter_a":"#ClintonResign","post_message":"The former secretary of state is looking for a more aggressive way to increase her poll numbers."},{"comment_id":"10153255280801336","commenter_b":"You can't fix stupid.
