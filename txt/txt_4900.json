People have gone to jail for it. And for every 1 person caught, you know there are more who aren't caught. And yes, foreign nationals who broke our laws to come here ARE less trustworthy, THEY BROKE OUR LAWS. We have enough home grown US haters and uninformed voters, we don't need to add people here illegally to the mix. They have no right to vote. If we can't ensure legal elections we are not protecting our sovereignty. Add that to unsecured borders and there is no USA any more. Try going to Mexico (or any country) illegally, see if they welcome you and let you chose their leaders. We are not bad people for wanting the same protections in our country that other countries offer their citizens.","commenter_a":"You mean undocumented democratic voters, right? CA has now given the right to vote to illegals. Supposedly in local races only. Who really believes that BS? What safeguards are in place to prevent them from voting in national races? None. And allowing them to vote in the first place is against the constitution. Just like illegals holding office is against the constitution. I shudder to think that CA's PC crap will pour into other states.","post_message":"\"We believe that this new law increases safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,\" a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles said."},{"comment_id":"10153249048488352","commenter_b":"Pure evil heartless bitch","commenter_a":"The same thing should happen to her no doubt about it","post_message":"Texas woman, 26, found guilty of suffocating fiancé's two-year-old daughter to death using duct tape after he broke up with her"},{"comment_id":"10153371654068855","commenter_b":"She's just trying to get famous.","commenter_a":"...why can't this bigoted bitch comprehend and accept REALITY?!
