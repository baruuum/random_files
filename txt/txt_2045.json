Please reconsider. Fight for a third party after the election or begin now but please don't let Trump win - the pleasure of the spite will not be worth it. Just look at the destruction, devastation, the inhumanity, wreckage of Bush presidency. If Hillary is defeated because of the spite of Bernie people it will be a Pyrrhic victory certainly.","commenter_a":"Bernie, I will follow you anywhere... but I won't be able to vote for HER. I don't begrudge you supporting her... I'm sure there was a lot of pressure to do so as well as strategic reasons. I CAN get behind down ballot progressives though!
