What if the baby has a condition incompatible with life or if the mother's life is at risk? What if it's an ectopic pregnancy that isn't always known by 6 weeks?","post_message":"Ohio lawmakers have passed a bill that would ban abortions in that state from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected."},{"comment_id":"10154683405811756","commenter_b":"Well what can one expect when they compromise their values to support an incompetent candidate for president for the sake of the Republican Party!

Imagine that wanting all to assimilate to Our laws ways traditions under our flag only if it offends you LEAVE go to Saudis Iranians enjoy sharia laws","commenter_a":"I didn't read anything about her being molested or disrespected. Maybe she went to the wrong rally? And who the hell says that a muslim woman should be more respected than anyone else? I don't care that she came in peace. As long as she left in one piece. I am sick of these muslims acting that everyone hates them. Some of us are just tired of their fictitious victimizations. There are real people in this country that have been victimized.

If that kid was crying in the middle of some restaurant & the owner told the mother to leave for the sake of the rest of the patrons he'd be applauded.
