That only people who subscribe to the stereotypical depiction of how black people dress and behave are 'real' black people? If that's not racist against African Americans, I don't know what is... Smh. And isn't the point of ending racism getting AWAY from stereotyping based on the color of a person's skin? The funny thing is, the meme maker -who is presumably black based on what the meme says- is *trying to* say that white people are racist, when in reality - they have such deeply rooted issues of their own that they didn't even realize their meme was racist against themselves. Start with yourself...","commenter_a":"Looks like she for sent home for having a black date nothing's wrong with her dress","post_message":"TOO REVEALING?
