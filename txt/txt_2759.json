What she poured into this election was ill gotten money. She sure didn't use her own. I Honestly feel her major Dissapointment is her self absorbed issues that would have only added more money to the Clintons Fraudulent Foundation . Being a Great Nation is now much more attainable without corrupt Killary and the rest of her lackeys.","commenter_a":"Wow. So much hate on these posts. I hear a lot of people upset about the protests going after she lost but it seems like there are just as many sore winners out there. Whether you like her or not, people need to learn some respect. I guarantee 99.9% of the people on here haven't the foggiest idea what it takes to hold a high ranking position in our government or run for president. She poured a lot of time and effort into her campaign and to still come up short must be a major disappointment. I'm sure a lot of people have done less and been more hurt by their own failures. I thought this was a country of conscience and good will. This election has proved we are much further from being a great nation than we claim.","post_message":"â€œI know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves if America is the country we thought it was.\""},{"comment_id":"10153974696736943","commenter_b":"Double talk.!","commenter_a":"This is how you stand for law in government?","post_message":"Wednesday, June 01, 2016 Judicial Watch Director of Research and Investigations Chris Farrell appeared on\"America's Newsroom\" on Fox News Channel to discuss the latest developments in the depositions of Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton inner circle regarding her use of private email while serving at the State Department."},{"comment_id":"1016517215129884","commenter_b":"@username why is she disgusting?
