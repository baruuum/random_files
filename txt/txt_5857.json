Especially after 911 we should have turned that entire part of the world into a sheet of glass. The women breed them, the kids are trained like them and are used as mercenaries. KILL THEM ALL. There are to many to sort out and sift through to decide who's good and who's not.

If you think that's not possible, please read \"The war on Money\". Yes, as Christians, God wants us to fight for his truth. but we have to realize not one president in the history of our country has been able to legislate morality and it will not start with the next one. America has a satan problem, until we remove him from our hearts as a nation no matter who we place in office will be able to make lick-spit of difference. But one candidate, Trump, has a unique ability and agenda to repair the financial disaster created by the establishment. The same establishment that positioned Cruz and Rubio as candidates. Cruz and Rubio are puppets of the RNC establishment!

I follow the Onion, and certainly didn't fall in line with Justice Scalia's opinions, but let me tell you this - this is a new standard of low. I could leave a brief comment, but this is so far beyond the usual pallor of any statement even a satirical form of journal should ever make, I find myself disgusted into making a statement. As human beings, we are all equal in death, but as Americans, we are something more. We are held to a certain equity of values that we inherit no matter where we fall on the narrow spectrum of political attitudes held in this country. And I am personally offended by the scrapping masses of groundlings hurling insults about a dead political figure before his family had even had a chance to attend the funeral. Shame on all of you.

All we get is liberal news and I think this is just propaganda and time to cancel choice for violation of our contract.","post_message":"This evening I wanted to share with you some news that is very personal to me.  Because you have been such a good friend and a strong supporter of all my efforts, I wanted you to know first that tonight I will do more than just say goodnight on my Fox show.  I will say goodbye.  This is the last edition of Huckabee on the Fox News Channel. It has been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasnÂ¹t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.  There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President.  I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support.  As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to leave a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America.  I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"},{"comment_id":"10150599168414999","commenter_b":"You only have the right to vote under certain criterion. If you want to use language like \"never was\" then I assume you forgot that only property owners were allowed to vote under the original constitution and blacks were also excluded. Changing times demand we evolve to the need. At this time we have tens of millions of Illegal aliens who have the ability to fraudulently vote. That is a potential problem.","commenter_a":"For me this is not about party politics as I am unaffiliated. 70% of Americans want voter ID. This is not about blocking the vote, this is about blocking the illegal vote. 52% of Dems, 82% of Repubs and 72% of independents agree want this, why should we ignore what is an obviously good idea?","post_message":"Democrats are most likely going to attack a host of measures, including voter identification requirements that Democrats consider onerous, time restrictions imposed on early voting, and rules that could nullify ballots cast in the wrong precinct."}]
