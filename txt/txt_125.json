Trump said he would renegotiate the trade deals so America gets a fair deal. You speak of the Colorado fiasco. What is crooked about it is that they locked the Trump delegates out and removed their names from the ballot. That is called rigging the election. Please take the class I suggested.","commenter_a":"Krauthammer, you think Cruz could handle China. Trump has done business with the Chinese. He know's what he is doing.

Say it with me. This Woman is money smart. She will wind up moving up at her job to the highest position, paying more taxes, and bettering her life. People around her will be better from her life.
