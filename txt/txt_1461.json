At age 72 I am with Stevie. I think we worked too hard to go backwards. I remember when I was first married there were states where it was against the law for a woman to use any form of birth control other than abstinence. If abortion is outlawed, how long before birth control will be outlawed.","post_message":"TRUTH."},{"comment_id":"10152821064059342","commenter_b":"^ they just don't have enough self control to keep from raping a woman unless shes covered apparently.","commenter_a":"Why do we have a muslim Capitol day?","post_message":"FBI RESPONDING TO MUSLIM CAPITOL DAY THREATS: Organizers say demonstrators are expected to protest against Thursday's rally.

That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in chapter 2 Section 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by , violence or other unconstitutional means. This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.
