Donald Trump has every right to his opinion. I agree that this country has had an influx of illegals for years. Be informed and know that Mexico and Guatemala have cut a deal to send thousands more to cross our borders illegally. The monies they send back to Mexico and Guatemala is $120 Billion dollars. This president wants to give them a free pass plus $35 thousand tax refunds? So they cross illegally, burden our health centers, schools, and oh only so you get my disgust! All I used to hear at the hospital is people telling other relatives of theirs to \"Come to the U.S., because this country is so stupid. They give you money for living, food stamps and oh if you have your babies in the U.S. , then they are citizens and you can stay\"... So these so called nice people ...","commenter_a":"Its a PR move.
