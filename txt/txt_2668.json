People have gone to jail for it. And for every 1 person caught, you know there are more who aren't caught. And yes, foreign nationals who broke our laws to come here ARE less trustworthy, THEY BROKE OUR LAWS. We have enough home grown US haters and uninformed voters, we don't need to add people here illegally to the mix. They have no right to vote. If we can't ensure legal elections we are not protecting our sovereignty. Add that to unsecured borders and there is no USA any more. Try going to Mexico (or any country) illegally, see if they welcome you and let you chose their leaders. We are not bad people for wanting the same protections in our country that other countries offer their citizens.","commenter_a":"You mean undocumented democratic voters, right? CA has now given the right to vote to illegals. Supposedly in local races only. Who really believes that BS? What safeguards are in place to prevent them from voting in national races? None. And allowing them to vote in the first place is against the constitution. Just like illegals holding office is against the constitution. I shudder to think that CA's PC crap will pour into other states.","post_message":"\"We believe that this new law increases safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,\" a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles said."},{"comment_id":"10152982959796130","commenter_b":"AMEN!","commenter_a":"Every member of Congress should do the same","post_message":"The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is meant to raise awareness about hunger and the struggle to live on such a limited budget."},{"comment_id":"589887647811084","commenter_b":"Please don't breed...","commenter_a":"Well I'd show an officer my id when asked, but some people feel differently and it's their right to walk away if they've done nothing wrong.
