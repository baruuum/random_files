They are one of the worst.","commenter_a":"You let them know not to call you again usually by hitting 3 but it doesn't matter as they'll call you again using another number. Most are spoofed numbers. I had my own phone number come up on Caller ID one time! there is a site that you can check out numbers, www.800notes.com to let others know about the callers but the telemarketers don't care about that site.
