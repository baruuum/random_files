After her talk she offers to answer questions from the kids. One little boy puts up his hand. Hillary asks him what his name is. \"Kenny,\" he says. \"And what is your question, Kenny?\" she asks. \"I have three questions,\" he says. \"First -- what happened in Benghazi? \"Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? \"Third -- what happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State?” Just then the bell rings for recess. Hillary tells the students that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says, \"Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time. Who has a question?” A different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up. Hillary points to him ...","post_message":"Yes. She.

What that means is, if one chooses to go against the 'rules' then that is on them. Its called \"free will\". I would advise against it according to my own spiritual belief's...but I have no right to take it any further than that with a non-believer. Its a touchy subject! We all have a gay person in our lives somewhere that we love, we may not like or agree with this life-style, and we do have a right to \"voice\" that, but that is where the right ends, and the rights of the gay person start...I only wish now the gays would see where THEIR rights end when dealing with those of us that are Not gay, and we do have Divine & Constitutional to disagree, but ...","post_message":"Marriage should be defined as it has always been. This is the ideal for raising children and is good for society. But while Americans are deeply divided on this issue, we should be able to agree that a Supreme Court decision would only exacerbate that division. Like the Roe v.
