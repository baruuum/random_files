She has the nerve to keep getting mileage out of Trump's remarks about her looks. Google \"Fiorina Gaffe\". If the media hadn't kept that video \"under wraps\" while at the same time raking Trump over the coals for his remark, the whole flap about her face would have been a \"non\" issue. She also left her campaign for Senator 5 million in debt and her staffers high and dry. Do your research before throwing support behind her.","post_message":"WATCH Carly run circles around the ladies of \"The View.\" Epic!"},{"comment_id":"10153801731062144","commenter_b":"@username I know that every pedophile must have a defense attorney, but I don't want anyone that defended one as a president!

Got my vote!","post_message":"\"I want you to remember: when you vote, when anyone votes, your vote matters as much as anybody else’s. Now, we may be up against super PACs and billionaires, but when the election comes around, Donald Trump and the Koch brothers with all their money, they only get one vote each. One person, one vote. That’s what we believe.  No one should be able to take that vote away. That’s why we cannot turn away and close our eyes from all of the attacks on voting rights that are happening right now. They don’t just threaten the integrity of our elections, although they do. They threaten what it means to be a citizen—indeed, what it means to be an American.\" —Hillary yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama"},{"comment_id":"10155404050665492","commenter_b":"Your entitled to carry your personal property anywhere you want .
