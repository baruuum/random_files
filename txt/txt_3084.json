What I am pointing out is that EVERY SINGLE POLL gives him a much wider lead over Trump than Hillary's lead. Most importantly in swing states. Who cares that Hillary won most of the Southern states, they are not going blue. Bernie won in most of the swing states and he polls dramatically better than her over Trump in those states. He may be losing the primaries, it is probable even. However if the point of this article is that Trump is such a threat to the presumptive Democratic nominee and we need to not be distracted by the primaries than it is fair to say, who is the better candidate to defeat Trump? Maybe for the sake of unity and defeating Trump, Hillary should bow out. You know, for the common good.","commenter_a":"I think we need to start asking the question is it time for Clinton to bow out of the race. Because if our main yardstick is not letting Trump be president all the polls are pretty clear, Sanders is our best bet.","post_message":"Yet Bernie Sanders is having none of it, frequently telling the thousands of supporters who attend his rallies that he still has a narrow path to the nomination."}]
