It is unfair to say that we need to re evaluate our values because we want some one who can beat her. In the end America as a whole is not voting evangelical prudence and wisdom would say pick any one who can beat her. My one and only comment. Blessings sister...","commenter_a":"Christians who support Trump need to reevaluate their values. I've never heard of Christians supporting a strip club owner who defends Planned Parenthood and doesn't care about marriage, but that's just me. Oh yeah, and swears continually!","post_message":"Editors' Note: The Christian Post has not taken a position on a political candidate before today.

The tunnels are for drugs. They don't want a lot of people knowing where the tunnels are because if the people get caught they will snitch on the tunnels location. That's why they use the tunnels for drugs not people","commenter_a":"The drugs are smuggled thru tunnels underground.","post_message":"A wall would do little, if anything, to stop the flow of illegal drugs - the majority of which are actually smuggled though checkpoints."}]
