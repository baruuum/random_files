The Republican primary was stronger because of the ideas he brought forth.   Marcoâ€™s story embodies the promise of our great nation. I know he will continue to be a champion for limitless opportunity in America, and I wish Marco, Jeanette, and their four kids the very best."},{"comment_id":"1038864972829192","commenter_b":"Children would suffer if women were drafted.","commenter_a":"#getridofthedraft","post_message":"Thoughts?"},{"comment_id":"10153287976081770","commenter_b":"'@username you may be right. But on the other hand maybe thats what this country needs now. A good dose of reality. Quit voting these life long politicians in office.","commenter_a":"Trump as President??? So everyone is all right with him insulting women, rude comments about Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Megyn Kelly,insulted the miltary, the disabled, John Mccain just to name a few. One of the meaniest and rude things he has done where he ripped it with me is a couple of days before Thanksgiving, at a rally in South Carolina he made fun of a New York Times reporter that had a physcial problem. Speaking as a person that has a physcial problem, that was very offensive! If I would have been at that rally, I would have knocked the living crap out of Trump! Trump thinks that he is going to be able to insult himself into The White House but oh boy, he is VERY wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","post_message":"Donald J.
