Feminism should be about equality not about following one group of women's notion about what you should look, feel or talk like.","commenter_a":"I'm seeing a lot of diversity in the Muslim community about the concept of World Hijab Day (non-Muslim women wearing the hijab for a day in solidarity). Would love to get your thoughts on whether it's cultural appropriation, or upholding the more conservative aspects of your faith. I did participate last year, but not sure if I will again.","post_message":"Her \"Ask a Muslim\" booth was a huge success! - Parker Molloy"},{"comment_id":"10152699530401051","commenter_b":"This brittany chick needs her head examined.","commenter_a":"He was born male, he died male.

Period. THEN it says she met him when she was 17, they dated while she was in college, and got married once she graduated. Can you imagine if you married the person you dated at 17? It wouldn't work for a LOT of people.","post_message":"\"And just like that, my plans to spend the rest of my life with the man I loved and my best friend were crushed.\""},{"comment_id":"982253175146252","commenter_b":"Surprised?

My mother died of ALS in June 1973 but was in the hospital and out many times and was never denied care. In fact she spent the last 3 months of her life in the hospital and had her nightly beer with my dad. Hopefully at some point in time they will get it figured out but sadly will probably not happen in my lifetime.","commenter_a":"That's exactly how they work. They deny, deny, deny until the person /family gives up hope. It is terrible how these people can get away with stealing/withholding money that these precious people put in and need.","post_message":"A few weeks ago, 11Alive shared the moving story of 42-year-old Melissa Kern. She had been battling ALS for almost a decade, and had reached a point where she could only move her eyelid to communicate. While she fought the disease, her husband Chris struggled to pay the bills, getting nothing from Social Security for disability benefits. Bill Liss 11Alive took on the case. They succeeded. Tragically, it was too late. See more: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154154942464205","commenter_b":"WOW.

Respect 🙏💜","post_message":"\"Many of us, me particularly, are from the units that have hurt you over the many years. We came. We fought you. We took your land. We signed treaties that we broke. We stole minerals from your sacred hills. We blasted the faced of our presidents onto your sacred mountain. When we took still more land and then we took your children and then we tried to make your language and we tried to eliminate your language that God gave you, and the Creator gave you. We didn’t respect you, we polluted your Earth, we’ve hurt you in so many ways but we’ve come to say that we are sorry. We are at your service and we beg for your forgiveness.\" - Wes Clark Jr. @webpagelink"}]
