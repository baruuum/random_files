So China, in my estimation, has a long way to go with their threats before they infringe on the liberties of their population to the degree to which \"we\" have ours.","commenter_a":"How does a person spread a rumour? It's nonsense. Rumours are spread by masses, not individuals. I suppose the whole country is a prison anyway.","post_message":"Chinese whispers: \"spreading rumours\" online is now punishable by seven years in prison"},{"comment_id":"10154334992691130","commenter_b":"Hillary claims to be for equal rights and pay for women and care for womens rights but she still pays men more than women.

He has no answers for you that are going to give you hope. He'd probably tell the children that they need to be vetted first to see if they love American values, even though they're only children.","post_message":"Ahead of tonight's debate, the children of Aleppo ask Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

When was the last time you saw a Buddhist terrorist, or a sikh terrorist, or for that matter an atheist terrorist? You just don't. Our biggest threats come from the middle east right now. It was perfectly fine while we were at war with the Japanese to pay extra attention to them. It was perfectly fine during WWII to keep an eye on immigrant Germans. What is the difference now? Why are we going to try and justify keeping our sovereign nation secure. Every other country does it. There is no law that says we have to accept immigrants. We are allowed to pick and choose, just ...","commenter_a":"Well, all was well and good until the part that was speaking of hate speech from the presidential candidate. Well he was obviously speaking of Mr. Trump. Unfortunately he is completely wrong. Mr. Trump used no hate speech at all. The only thing said was that he thinks we should stop the middle eastern refugee immigration until we could confidently vet them. This would be a temporary action. But of course the way the bleeding heart liberal media spins it, is that he want to cut off all immigration. This is another one of those stories that is attempting to drive the narrative and falsely force people to have negative opinions without the facts. The media wants people to believe that Mr. Trump said these awful things because the media hasn't been able to manipulate him and force him to fall into step.
