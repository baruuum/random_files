I have compiled videos and links that when put together, you will have a full understanding on how our country is being invaded. Please help spread this around the country--Radio stations, tv stations, governors,mayors, groups,unions, etc. Let's not act as democrats or republicans. we all need to unite and fight for our country as Americans. @webpagelink There is no refugee crisis. The six wealthy Gulf countries Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain have offered to receive exactly zero Syrian refugees.

What do you know about Hillary's REAL immigration policy, which will bring MILLIONS of radical, ideologically subverted maniacs here, who believe it is their right to oppress, enslave and kill women, gays and all LGBT people?

The student said that, through his outfit, he had wanted to keep the dialogue about slavery going. He felt that at school the topic was sometimes covered up. \"I was like, OK, I need to make my voice heard and make sure these people did know that slavery did happen back in the day,\" he said in a phone interview Wednesday. Ibe's look didn't last long. He arrived Tuesday to the school in Missouri City about 30 minutes early, he said. When he walked through the main entrance and began down the hallway, he said an assistant principal pulled him into an office. They waited for the principal, who told him the outfit was inappropriate and that he needed to change, Ibe said. But taking off the outfit didn't mean he would drop the issue.
