If a child misbehaves, I don't wait for the parents to take action; ESPECIALLY if the little brat hits me. I'll tear that ass up. I wish my daughter would have acted up at someone else's house to the point that they would even have to consider disciplining her. They wouldn't have time because I'd been on her ass.
