I agree, there should be further evidence required to prove you are a citizen. Maybe a place on your driver's license should be reserved for this information. Not only are these illegals breaking the law to come here, they are electing people like Marco \"The Chihuahua\" Rubio to be their senator. Oh, and Google: \"Rubio Gay Arrest\" to see what Rubio likes to do in his spare time.","commenter_a":"Voter fraud has been proven in tx.

HOMICIDE..DOUBLE STANDARDS","commenter_a":"Why are people so fixated on someone's death? That is, ONLY if the tool used happened to be a firearm? Why not by other tools and means? #1. There is no gun death epidemic in America. In fact, many more people are killed each year by abortion, alcohol, tobacco, obesity, vehicles, prescription drugs, drownings, STDS... #2. Murder is not on the rise in America. In fact, violent crimes across the board are down some 50%, and have been falling for the last 20 plus years. This despite the fact that firearm ownership is quickly rising more each year. Studies even show where private firearm ownership is the highest, crime is the lowest. #3. Many of the same people who are supposedly against the deaths of a small percentage of people by firearms, are perfectly happy to murder their own sons and daughters by the millions each year. Talk about hypocrisy! ...","post_message":"Police locked down a South Florida mall after one person was killed and another was injured in a shooting."}]
