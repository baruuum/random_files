You are not paying taxes for those employees right? The people Trump wants deported are Criminals! Are those the employees you have working for you?

I can't believe how many Americans are so brainwashed against a little socialism. You guys at \"the top\" gotta get back to basics. The greed in your country is appalling. We are the lucky ones to still have subsidized healthcare. Taxes should go first to education and not onky spelling and writing, but to teaching life-skills, budgeting, health. 2nd to health including dental health. Tax the crap out of the fat and sugar laden processed foods. Start caring for community and stop supporting the conglomerates. Yay for Obama. The best president since JFK, only mote moral in his private life.","post_message":"BREAKING: President Obama to call for 2 years of free community college for all students.
