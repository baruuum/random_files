The zoo done what had to be done at the time they were not aware that a child could get into the cage or I'm sure it would have been fixed","post_message":"Cincinnati Zoo keepers had no choice but to kill a gorilla that might have harmed a small child that somehow got into its enclosure.  But the Internet has been lit aflame by animal lovers furious at the parents for allowing the situation to happen.  They‚Äôve reportedly received death threats and demands that they be prosecuted.     But animal expert and TV host Jeff Corwin points out that it‚Äôs nothing new.  One study showed that 42% of deaths and injuries from captive tiger attacks involved visitors, many of them kids, and not zoo keepers.  He has an important message for all zoo visitors, especially parents:    ‚ÄúWhen you go to these places, the zoo is not your babysitter. You have a responsibility.‚Äù   I wonder if our constant immersion in TV, movies and virtual reality is making people forget how to behave in ‚Äúreal‚Äù reality. The same obliviousness that allows people to yak on cell phones in Broadway theaters just as if they‚Äôre sitting at home in front of their TVs is also leading them to assume that real zoo animals are no more dangerous than those in a video game.  In real reality, you don‚Äôt get to press the Reset button for an endless number of lives.
