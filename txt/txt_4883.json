Where she says, \"I considered myself a feminist before it was cool, now everyone is claiming it?\" She said that a while ago. First, tell that to Gloria Steinem, honey.

Several people received transplants from my daughter and nothing happened to their skin. We are all the same inside and the only difference outside is that African American people have MORE pigment genes than white people. You did get their genes transplanted into you you got their organs which are exactly like yours that obviously failed. So what difference does it make where they came from. BE GRATEFUL YOU ARE ALIVE. And since you have to take medicine for the rest of your life so your body won't reject your transplants use your pee brain which you obviously have and think about the medicine that's affecting your skin color and NOT the fact that an African American gave you his/her parts to keep your sorry butt alive.","post_message":"This man says that receiving a transplant from an African-American has turned his skin black.
