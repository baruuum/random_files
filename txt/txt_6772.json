The system is crooked!","post_message":"STATEMENT REGARDING TRUMP UNIVERSITY It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard.

What is wrong with that!??","commenter_a":"A woman protesting in New York City just said she was protesting because Trump doesn't represent her beliefs! Well that's why we had an election yesterday and America spoke clear and loud that they were fed up with the way our country was going.
