She ran HP into the ground.","commenter_a":"I have thought the same thing about Carly Fiorina. I like her and believe technically she might make a good president. But she has a 'look' about her, not about beauty or sexiness, but a look like she's been hurt badly sometime in her life and is going to have a nervous breakdown at any minute. Leadership also relies heavily on appearance and Ms. Fiorina's 'look' just isn't motivational. It's almost all about appearance...when is the last time you've seen a multi-million dollar preacher that looks like he/she just lost their puppy? This country is going to need vitality to rebuild itself and she does not project that; FDR would not be photographed in his wheelchair and people still talk about Jimmy Carter's preacher look. We need and I haven't seen anyone that 'appears' to resemble him, except maybe Sen. Marco Rubio, and only somewhat, a JFK.","post_message":"Trump was watching a newscast when a video clip zoomed in on rival Republican 2016 candidate Carly Fiorina. 'Look at that face!

Good for her for getting rid of that douche.","commenter_a":"The same thing happened to my best friend when she started to make a healthier lifestyle for herself. Her now ex wouldn't support her at all! She was supposed to come to the gym with me one day and completely bailed out because she was fighting with her a**hole boyfriend. Turns out he told her that she's fat, will always be fat and that there was no point in going to the gym with me when she'll quit anyway. Now I wasn't aware about what he told her until recently because she was so ashamed of what he told her and knew I'd bash the crap out of him. He'd also accuse her of cheating every single time she went out or 'joke' to her about texting other guys whenever she pulled her phone out. He was the one who ended up cheating (or so we think but I'm sure ...","post_message":"Alexander's husband started calling her 'fat' after she dropped weight to save her health."},{"comment_id":"10153544587506350","commenter_b":"Real women dont need all that!
