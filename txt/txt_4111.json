When I was 14 I lived off of 14th and Pierce by Casa Bonita....and had to catch the bus on Colfax for school. If I would have reported every dude who cat called, they would have needed a daily report for me alone on the news. I'm really not trying to down play the fact that this guy could have been a weirdo but this seems a little extreme.","post_message":"Keep an eye out, Colorado.

If history has taught us anything, it proves we must remain vigilant against such cowardly, terrorist attacks. America can lead, and we have the strength to do so, but currently lack the leadership. My hope is that our national leaders grasp why so many Americans, including myself, want the Border secured so that we not only deal with the issue of illegal immigration but we also ensure terrorists do not cross our border to do us harm. Never has the old adage been more true: The World is safer when America is Strong: Our People know it, Our Allies know it, and most importantly, Our Enemies know it."},{"comment_id":"10154672636522994","commenter_b":"Not me Jonathon.
