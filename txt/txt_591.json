All my experience is the other side where CPS literally kidnaps the children for the hospital on lies and stories that get twisted and turned, so it sounds like abuse. Looks like we know opposit ends of the fight with CPS. No matter what is going on in these children's lives, I just wish the children were put first. When you take children from their homes, good or bad homes, put them in counseling. Do not drug them all up and do not allow them to be abused by the system.","commenter_a":"How about CPS just stop stealing kids!","post_message":"Sacramento County CPS is holding an event at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but if you can't make it, we've included contact information to find out more about the program."},{"comment_id":"10153405844391955","commenter_b":"Cruz is a phony with his evangelical persona","commenter_a":"Trump's record makes him look like the flip flopping, inconsistent political opportunist he is. The right personality and talking the way we like without looking at policies, are the criteria the Democrats selected Obama in 2008. Donald Trump has supported a net worth tax, 35% tarrif, he supports amnesty and a path to citizenship, \"because there are jobs Americans just won't do,\" He's donated to clinton Pelosi & Harry Reid, and has said Bush is the worst president ever. He's a RINO and a caricature of a conservative inartfully voicing every failed mudsling of the left against conservatives. Ted Cruz is a world class debater, with a nearly perfect record who takes on both Democrats and spineless Republicans. He has all the positives and then some without the negatives of Trump. #TedCruz2016 @webpagelink","post_message":"NEW 'SILENT MAJORITY'"},{"comment_id":"10154342648916509","commenter_b":"Shut up","commenter_a":"The decision to continue with fireworks in spite of huge fire at hotel nearby shows the sadist attitude of Arub nation.","post_message":"#NewYearsEve fireworks display continues in #Dubai as nearby hotel is engulfed in flames @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154089965446336","commenter_b":"Yeah, lice likes very clean hair.
