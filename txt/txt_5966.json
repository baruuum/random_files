In the 21st century private corporations have power equal to or even greater than a government's over people's platforms for speech and expression. In 10 years it is entirely possible that a single multi-national company will control all of the major social media platforms.

Mark Zuckerberg will eagerly jump into bed with any ruthless dictator and agree to censorship on that country's population.","commenter_a":"There is no free speech war to be had.
