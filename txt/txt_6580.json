You are well spoken, but you are not a happy person obviously. Not one smile! Mostly grimace. As to your subject matter-good for the blows to Hilliary and putting Christie in his place. But your arrogant head bobbing when talking about meeting foreign leaders etc. is just overboard. You better get on board with Trump, only the media and establishment hate him and are tryin their best to convince audience that he is hated. VOTERS want him!!! Voters love him!!!","post_message":"Putin won't listen to more talk. We need to show him there's strength, leadership, and courage on the other side.

The police's job in this case is to apprehend suspects. Suspects are innocent until proven guilty and should be treated as such.","post_message":"\"I've never been cursed, physically abused, beaten and treated like a slave as I was two days ago.\" A retired corrections officer says he was assaulted by Garden City Police in a case of mistaken identity.

HILLARY CLINTON being in lockstep with him, and just like him, she also felt the need to go around the world and apologize for all the things we supposedly did in the past. Never mind of all the aid and the freedom many Democracies are enjoying because of us and the blood we shed for them. We helped them and still helping them not because we but because is our duty to all the Millions of American citizens who came from those places and all their loved ones who are still living there! So, instead of leading from behind, when will our Nation have a pious and righteous President, a Constantine, a Theodosius, a Justinian, who will not be afraid, ...","commenter_a":"You're the best president, I'm from England but thanks for everything you have done Obama, especially for the LGBTQ+ community.","post_message":"President Obama's final State of the Union is on January 12.

Seriously, he is a POS and he is nothing but a racist, a liar, a cheat, a thief, and I could go on. He is a danger to America....and if he can't run his casinos, his own campaign, think about what he will do to America. He will run it into the ground. It is pretty scary to think if he gets in the Whitehouse, he will insult other countries, and possibly be the first president to incite a war because of his mouth.","post_message":"\"Hillary Clinton  may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States,\" Donald J.
