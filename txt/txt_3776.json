Look at how God backed the Christians when they slaughtered 100 million native Indians because they foolishly loved their land and their own spirits, not accepting Christ as the son of God..... so, they were slaughtered... but, they told the men not to waste the ammunition on the women and kids, so they slashed them to death with sabers and machetes.... and God smiled at them...... And, since WW II the Christian Americans have invaded 37 countries killing between 20 and 30 million people, none of them were white Christians though, so God again smiled and nodded with His approval...... We spent $3 trillion on killing 500,000 innocent Iraqi citizens.... or $6 million per person killed..... it is really getting expensive to kill people nowadays isn't it..... Just think if we had spent that $3 trillion on food, we would have ...","commenter_a":"The Hillary and government set up is trying to keep the polls low for trump an high for hilkery, with the media and asking him politely bow out when Hillary wins it's all to hide the fact that they are cheating and they expect to win by their cheating so it will look good when they say she has won and Obama said he would not leave the White House and would blockade anyone coming in but they are trying to make Trump say that he won't fight.

There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems. HRC cannot denounce Fracking. Now, before you think that article that spells out how much HRC is taking in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry is another Republican smear tactic, note that it is by Greenpeace. She has to go. ...","post_message":"\"We can open the door to every person in this country again.\" â€”President Bill Clinton"},{"comment_id":"633195336830149","commenter_b":"Illegal invaders","commenter_a":"Feed them, clothe them.
