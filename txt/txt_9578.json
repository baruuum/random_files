It is oblivious to the fact that the non-coastal parts of California are similar to the non-coastal parts of the rest of the United States. It is oblivious to the reality that the state's financial crisis is due to overspending within California and not because they're sending money to D.C."},{"comment_id":"908907002538886","commenter_b":"Kool aid Oh Yea...","commenter_a":"Lol I love my president. ‚úäüèæ","post_message":"‚ÄúBernie Sanders might run‚Ä¶ apparently some folks really want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the White House.

Can you see your 16 year old neighbor going to the recruitment office to try to lie about his age to enlist? They're called \"The Greatest Generation\" for a reason. We'd have everyone trying to sue the government for various reasons rather than fighting. It is a different world we live in, with different core values in the newer generations. Even the older generations are wasting their time debating bathroom rights... THESE kids knew what was important, and were willing to give all for their beliefs. I can't salute them enough, or honor them enough, or thank them enough. And having served overseas for the majority of my time in the service, and living in Germany, I was fortunate enough to see just what the older generation of Germans felt for these people who did so ...","post_message":"We remember, and give thanks. #DDay"},{"comment_id":"10154133163039032","commenter_b":"Ohhh waaaa, namecalling hurts soooo bad, better to be a pig and be free than to be \"hip\" and be a socialist.
