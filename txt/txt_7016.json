He is not a politician, he is a hard nosed businessman. The borders should have been closed a long time ago, illegals need to go, refugees need to find another country to bleed for free stuff.

I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan, he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time that he has brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as, immigration, \"the wall\" and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he is standing at the podium, next to one of the Democrats. THAT is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business, without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set.
