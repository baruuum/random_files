I'll be so glad when we don't have to look at his ugly mug and that bitch he is married to.","commenter_a":"That slimy weasel traitor grin makes me sick.","post_message":"Congrats, Democrats. You will soon own it now and forever."},{"comment_id":"510102432525283","commenter_b":"What a dumbass!","commenter_a":"Well duh!!! I thought everyone knew the all you can eat means is all YOU, just you, only you, your stomach, can hold, I didn't realize that there were ppl stupid enough to think they could go into a restaurant and get the all you can eat whatever and feed 5 or 6 of your friends on YOUR all YOU can eat ....are ppl really out there that are that stupid ? If so for the love of God spay and neuter them so as to prevent them from bringing more ridiculously stupid ignorant ppl into this world","post_message":"The Denny's workers here repeatedly tried to explain the rules about all-you-can-eat-pancakes to this lady - and that's when she completely snapped."},{"comment_id":"10153221947888984","commenter_b":"I pray Bibi wins. I believe he will, because if the Lord is on your side, who can stand against you?","commenter_a":"Please vote wisely Israel; the world needs Bibi to lead in the fight against Iranian nukes. Our administration won't, so we need you to lead the free world.","post_message":"It's down to the wire in Israel, as anti-Bibi Obama keeps a close eye on critical elections there. Do you support Bibi Netanyahu?"},{"comment_id":"10153425885744255","commenter_b":"Look, bozo, I suggested 68. It's 66 now. That's two years, not nine. That's my answer. Thanks for the cute little story, though.","commenter_a":"Social security was developed when people rarely lived to be 65. It's stupid to keep it at 65 in this day and age.

She's disarming when she speaks, and able to get persuasive messages about individual liberty across to people who instinctively resist it. If she's nominated by the GOP, I think she has the best chance to win. If she's elected, she could invigorate the conservative/ libertarian movement and put our nation back on course.","post_message":"Today in Barrington, New Hampshire I toured Turbocam International and heard from voters ready for citizen leadership in Washington at a packed townhall.

Oh wait, they already have.","commenter_a":"It looks like your allies have a far more accurate picture of Trump that the American morons who vote for him do. He has made America a great laughing stock around the world. If America is to regain any pride, you MUST DUMP HERR TRUMP.; he is a danger to the whole world. If we could all vote, about 6 Billion people would vote No to Trump..","post_message":"These drawings are PERFECT."},{"comment_id":"10153541842375329","commenter_b":"Kim has a nice body","commenter_a":"Who wore it better?
