Mexico doesn't want them back and they send millions if not billions to pump up Mexico's economy and drain our economy. Many of these immigrants are from further south than Mexico. Mexico wants to keep them out of their country as well that's why they put a large wall on their southern border. Why are they allowed to do that yet we are not???

This is the ideal for raising children and is good for society. But while Americans are deeply divided on this issue, we should be able to agree that a Supreme Court decision would only exacerbate that division. Like the Roe v.
