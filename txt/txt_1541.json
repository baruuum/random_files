The others, all executive vice presidents, were: Barbara Res, who was in charge of construction of Trump Tower and then the Plaza; Blanche Sprague, head of project development; and Susan Heilbron, who was Trump chief lawyer.","post_message":"“Nobody has more respect for women than I do,” Donald J. Trump said. “Thirty years ago I had a woman building a major construction project in New York City. That never happens. I’ve been great to women and they’ve been great to me.

It is in San Francisco that an illegal alien killed a beautiful person. He encourages sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants and lets them get drivers licenses and so with liberals it's take from the people who work and pay taxes and let them pay for all the illegals. I don't want to give my hard earned money to whatever the state chooses to spend it on but liberals will continue until they are ousted. And that goes for Republicans as well. No one in either party deserves to hold office if 'our' welfare doesn't come first. And I don't mean welfare as in free stuff.","commenter_a":"what...how can any illegal alien hold a government position?

Look women can be tough. BUT the toughest women are weaker than the toughest men. it's called gender dimorphism. Most mammals have it. That isn't to say that somewhere a woman isn't going to show up that can play running back, but with thinner, softer bones she's also more likely to get killed or seriously hurt.","post_message":"She's not going out without a fight."}]
