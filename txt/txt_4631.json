But doggier....she \"kept\" you. She got you back. By completely NOT ANYTHING like what you thought you married. She's an evil, money-hungry, evil, liar, in a position in government she shouldn't even be a janitor that empties her garbage can, ugly (well, she's always been ugly) and a moral-less female. So I guess it does end up how it should be in the end. She should sit in jail the rest of her life. You two are the epitome if what a marriage should not ever be. And you sound proud! You're both despicable.","commenter_a":"Terri Bock","post_message":"\"I married my best friend.

And accept this mockery of a gay marriage. All religions in the world are against gay marriage. Its unholy, unatural and discusting and a general majority agree with that. Look at how muslims treat them lol. You wanna be a fruitcake? Fine, but stop throwing your discusting life in normal ppl's faces with ur ridiculous parade of freaks and now want to step into normal familly life of husband and wife. Its not for you. Adam and Eve. Man and Woman. NOT adam and steve! Marriage is between a MAN and a WOMAN. Amen to the sister with enough conviction to stand her ground. This is just the beginning. Her stand has awakened MANY. Its about to get nasty for a few :)","commenter_a":"Kentucky Christians should march for her. Don't remain silent, be there for the sister.
