She said she simply said yada and the people who were complaining didn't see the interview. Well I saw the interview and she lied. Not to be undone though, after a few minutes with Bill Maher, she actually showed her true colors and did admit what she believes. Then to top it off, as soon as Bill Maher brought up their support for Ralph Nader, which cost the country GW Bush and millions of lives, she simply interrupted, pivoted and changed the subject. She is a horrible human being and I wouldn't watch another movie with her in it on a bet...even if she does have the best rack of any 70 year old(Oct) I've seen.","post_message":"Susan Sarandon found herself in the hot seat Friday night."},{"comment_id":"1117289745030745","commenter_b":"Joshua DeVere you don't like vaginas?
