A business either prospers of fails on its own merits, period! None should be \"too big to fail\"! Throwing trillions of dollars at a sinking ship is madness, it just prolongs the inevitable and hurts those that are being forced to pay for using their stolen tax paid monies, and harming the entirety of the economy, we are here to bail out the billionaires and globalist elites delusional scam they are perpetrating on man kind!","commenter_a":"What an asshole and she probably makes a 6 figure salary, time to clean house","post_message":"Not sure about you, but this REALLY pisses me off!

The whole thing starts when a man can't keep it in his pants. He has no business telling women what they should or shouldn't do.","post_message":"Let me share a piece of myself. Yours truly was abandoned as a newborn by a man who now he is 100% against abortion. I guess me being taken to Arkansas and being raised by an abusive stepfather (and the first few years in a shack with an outhouse and a well for water) was OK. I appreciate that I had a chance at life. But you men who think you can make decisions for women? STFU.

This kind of game playing makes you look more the fool. Most people today couldn't pick a transgender out of a line-up of people. They've been using our public bathrooms according to the sex they identify with, live and dress as, all these past decades to no uproar. Now all of the numskulls have come out of the woodwork claiming their women and children will be raped in the toilet stall because men are going to swarm into the ladies room because the law says they can. Get this: sexual predators don't follow laws in the first place and no law will stop them from getting their next victim be it in a bathroom or anywhere else.","commenter_a":"I will be packing better know what you are doing or you will be peeing like a girl for real !!!","post_message":"You want to try using the ladies' room, bro . . . the politicians and the media might be OK with you, but as for the ladies themselves, I wouldn't be so sure."},{"comment_id":"10154416632443701","commenter_b":"He already said he's voting for her lol","commenter_a":"Ugh!! Until I hear it from his mouth I don't believe it. Why should we believe ANYTHING a biased news station and a corrupt politicians say? In fact, if you read the article, it specifically says Bernie has not announced he endorsed her. Coming together in issues is NOT the same. Mis-leading headline, once again!! Sanders has not yet said he will endorse Clinton but told reporters on Saturday that the two campaigns were coming together and to stay tuned.","post_message":"Former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders will join Hillary Clinton at a New Hampshire event on Tuesday where he plans to endorse her."},{"comment_id":"10155235641066037","commenter_b":"Very true, so it's OK for them to think they can sneak in because they can't afford to become a citizen? We have plenty of people out of work and those are jobs the unemployed could be working now isn't it. No wonder Trump wants to cut funds to these city's. That opens up more jobs to Americans, because there is a minimum wage in states and you are not suppose to hire illegals.","commenter_a":"Sanctuary city's think the above the law and don't have to enforce the law.","post_message":"\"I don't have a clue,\" said U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly."},{"comment_id":"10153896668671990","commenter_b":"She need the flowjob","commenter_a":"Why didn't this happen to my poll areas","post_message":"Two women, naked from the chest up, bust into a Manhattan polling station early Tuesday, shouting:  of our polls Trump, out of our polls Trump!
