That mother is a monster!","commenter_a":"I don't know that it's child abuse, so much as poor parenting. Different religions physically discipline their children, pursuant to their faith - there's a line where it become child abuse, but I don't know that that threshold has been met. As to the poor parenting - yeah, she really should not have done this. Humiliation of a child is not ever going to be the correct form of discipline. And, it will likely result in later life issues. This is a private matter, which should have remained in the home. If the girl had friends, then they should have been told in private, not through a public shaming. And I would hope the mother focuses less on the letter grade and more on the actual learning. If your child thinks that 'allowed' and 'aloud' are the same thing - your problem is bigger than you realize.","post_message":"A mother is facing child abuse charges after she sent her daughter to middle school wearing a 'public shaming' t-shirt for getting 'F's in all of [her] classes.'"},{"comment_id":"931439316891490","commenter_b":"And the POPE lives in the woods!]","commenter_a":"It may as well be true.
