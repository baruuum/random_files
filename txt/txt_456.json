I served this country for my beliefs and I'll be damned whether people like you like my opinions or not.

It dates back to at best sometime in the late 70s/early 80s. I remember a girl in my youth group had brought one of her Mormon friends one summer's eve, and I got into a conversation with her and I'll remember what she said til the day I die- 'I'm not a Christian, I'm a Mormon!' That would have been 74 or 75. Also, the concept that 'As God was, so man is; as God is so man may become' is utterly missing from the other thee Abrahamic faiths.","commenter_a":"Um, no.
