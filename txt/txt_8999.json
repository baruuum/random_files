If you see the pictures and videos, there are lounge chairs and tables just feet away from the water. People can read the \"no swimming\" sign, but an alligator is not going to think twice about coming on land. I think Disney needs to close off areas where there are gators. I lived in Tampa for four years, and gators were everywhere near water. You just knew where they were, and if you didn't, there were signs. I doubt people did not know about the alligators; you can always spot them especially if there are more than three. This could have been prevented.","commenter_a":"Why were alligators allowed to be so close to where human activity is?

That is, ONLY if the tool used happened to be a firearm? Why not by other tools and means? #1. There is no gun death epidemic in America. In fact, many more people are killed each year by abortion, alcohol, tobacco, obesity, vehicles, prescription drugs, drownings, STDS... #2. Murder is not on the rise in America. In fact, violent crimes across the board are down some 50%, and have been falling for the last 20 plus years. This despite the fact that firearm ownership is quickly rising more each year. Studies even show where private firearm ownership is the highest, crime is the lowest. #3. Many of the same people who are supposedly against the deaths of a small percentage of people by firearms, are perfectly happy to murder their own sons and daughters by the millions each year. Talk about hypocrisy! ...","post_message":"Police locked down a South Florida mall after one person was killed and another was injured in a shooting."},{"comment_id":"10153498336211955","commenter_b":"Why would anyone go?
