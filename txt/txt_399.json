Go Trump","commenter_a":"Trump now has my vote. This lawlessness has to stop. There is nothing racist about wanting to enforce laws that apply to everyone. I do hope he can be talked out of the wall though. We need improved cooperation and relations with Mexico. Not a big wall dividing us. Both countries need to crack down on crime and make sure people moving between the two countries do it legally. Only way to have a civilized society is to enforce the laws. If laws are unfair, let's change them. But let's do it legally and civilly. Trump is not the racist monster that the liberal propaganda machine makes him out to be.","post_message":"\"Hundreds of cars were forced to make a U-turn less than three miles from a Donald Trump rally today after protesters parked in the highway to block Trump supporters from reaching the event.\""},{"comment_id":"895487660544289","commenter_b":"I wanna find the actual article sited for this one","commenter_a":"Tiffany Rae üòê","post_message":"Another colossal Republican waste of taxpayer money."}]
