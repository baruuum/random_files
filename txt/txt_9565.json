In non-Muslim societies, such Muslims may subscribe to, and be vested with, secular identities. Reminder: Obama father was a Kenyan born muslim. ----- al-Taqiyya: deception; the islamic word for concealing or disguising one beliefs, convictions, ideas, feelings, opinions, and/or strategies. Islam Permits Lying to Deceive Unbelievers and Bring World Domination! Muslims lie when it is in their interest to do so and will not hold them accountable for lying when it is beneficial to the cause of Islam. They can lie without any guilt or fear of accountability or retribution.

I am an immigrant to this country and I have no intention of imposing my way of life on every person living here or subjugating the \"indigenous\" people of this land. I think I can speak for the vast majority of immigrants in saying that they also do not intend to do so. Most immigrants integrate into society. Perhaps you just don't like the way they look like. As was stated before, Britain is 85% white. All these people fearing that this country is swamped by brown and black people, Eastern Europeans and other pesky foreigners need to get their facts together. Moreover, study after study has proven that immigration is indeed beneficial to the British economy. We may also not forget that Britons emigrate to other countries in large numbers. This is not a one way street. Immigration is part of ...","commenter_a":"For a country whose language is a mix of old german, latin and celtic language, i'm laughing. In the past, Brits never had any issue with colonizing Australia our the US and imposing their culture (or \"civilization\") to the native populations. That's so ironic !","post_message":"A quarter of Britons think the government should encourage immigrants and their families to leave. That's people like Mehdi Hasan. He argues that while hostility to outsiders may not be a new phenomenon, the so-called immigration debate is now toxically out of control. Anti-immigration sentiment isn't a result of increased immigration, but fear and prejudice  Meera Syal: Growing up between cultures is tough – until you realise it’s a creative blessing: @webpagelink"}]
