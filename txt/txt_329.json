I get them all the time on my business phone and my unlisted home phone. Especially Google. They are one of the worst.","commenter_a":"You let them know not to call you again usually by hitting 3 but it doesn't matter as they'll call you again using another number. Most are spoofed numbers. I had my own phone number come up on Caller ID one time! there is a site that you can check out numbers, www.800notes.com to let others know about the callers but the telemarketers don't care about that site. I see a lot of people on there saying to 'Stop calling me!' yet don't leave their number. Yes, I'm tired of the 'Lower Your Credit Card Interest' or letting me know about a topical pain ointment. Be aware of those calling saying that they are the IRS or police telling you to pay up using a pre-paid debit card.

Blanket misconceptions are counterproductive, especially when it comes to school. Much like the Pledge crap that goes around... we do the Pledge, even if Fox news says otherwise.","commenter_a":"When my children are sick, they'll miss school. When they have dentist appts they'll miss school. If I decide it, they'll miss school. I'm the parent, our family's needs come before school administration's needs. Period. The school is LUCKY to havey children attend and i warch them like a hawk. Our childrens mental health is more important than grades and standardized testing!! And @username you've got to be high on meth if you think for one minute every doorstep wants or needs a social worker or, the GOVERNMENT rather, invading their privacy, trying to make parenting decisions or stomping on civil liberties on even the smallest scale. I wouldn't put up with that for a second. And haven't you been paying attention to what a total, corrupt failure DHS is anyway??? Ridiculous notions.","post_message":"Oregon schools have done little to intervene despite having 94,000 students miss at least 10 percent of the school year."}]
