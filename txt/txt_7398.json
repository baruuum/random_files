If there is even a small chance my child could be exposed to diphtheria, whooping cough, or the measles, or polio, you can believe I will do whatever I can to protect them from these horrendous diseases. If you want to play Russian Roulette with those chances, that is up to you.","commenter_a":"Thanks for taking the time to let us see who you really are. I am more and more impressed by you each day.","post_message":"Each night I try and carve out some time to answer questions from my friends on Facebook. You can submit your questions by sending them to me via email at AskBen@BenCarson.com. I am out in Jackson, Wyoming tonight and my, is it pretty out here. The first question tonight is one I see comments on occasionally. It is from Devon and it is about childhood vaccinations. Devon, as you know, I spent my life with a Pediatric specialty. As a Pediatric Neurologist, I feel I have a very solid understanding of the developing brain of a child. Devon as you know, my life's work was in a pediatric specialty, caring for 15,000 children to ensure that they could live full, productive, and healthy lives.

Maybe we should be concentrating on people who arnt entitled coming to this county just for the benefits and Nhs and maybe the government should be claiming back the millions we loose in this way. I don't expect Katie price or other celebs are a drain on our economy as some people who claim benefits with no intention of ever working.","commenter_a":"The benefit system isn't struggling & costs being cut because of Katie Price, it's struggling because of the generation of freeloaders who see Benefits as a career choice, people who can work & pay taxes but don't; If everyone in this country that can work had the right work ethic we wouldn't be in half the mess we are. I was always brought up benefits are for those who need it for clothes, warmth, food, the essentials - including specialist care for the disabled, people nowadays have full sky packages watched on 50\" tvs, have a social life and go abroad for holidays all from benefits, where's the incentive then to get off their backsides and go to work. Whilst I'm not her biggest fan Katie price pays much more than her fair share in tax, she's a grafter & a worker, her son deserves his benefit rights in return","post_message":"\"This is exactly why universal benefits matter. Defend the right of mothers of disabled children, such as Price, to get help, and it reinforces the rights of everyone else. That’s how society works. Strengthen one pillar and the other gets bolder; weaken one and it won’t be long before they all start to crumble.\""},{"comment_id":"657748434349749","commenter_b":"CANCEL the game, go to half time show, then go home.
