People killing and fighting everyone. Not everyone has the money to buy guns or the nads to pull a trigger. Hopefully that never happens but I am guessing people would try and leave, some in a hurry to wherever is better and closest....and hopefully don't get turned away at borders.","commenter_a":"Why, oh why, can't the pot stirrers understand the difference between LEGAL and ILLEGAL when it comes to immigration?!? The US was indeed made up of immigrants, and we love immigrants still, WHO COME HERE LEGALLY.

Why is that such a hard concept for some people? Seriously! Do you really think any other country in the world would put refugees AHEAD of its own citizens?!? No! Americans first, then help others. Just like in an airplane, put YOUR oxygen mask on first, then help the ones around you.
