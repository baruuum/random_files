End of that story !!!","commenter_a":"Please do some research. What does your state actually offer in the way of public assistance to noncitizens? In California noncitizens are not eligible to cash assistance or Calfresh (foodstamps). No Social Security or Medicare without legal residency. So just what are you haters talking about? I hope none of you ever find yourselves in a financial situation which would drive you away from your home in order to survive. I hope you don't call yourself \"Christians\" because you are so far from the core of that belief.","post_message":"Should illegal immigrants be banned from receiving Obamacare subsidies? That was far from the case in 2015."},{"comment_id":"1017395615037845","commenter_b":"@username Border security is far more lax than it has ever been. Obama gives the border patrol and ICE orders to stand down all the time, which is a major contributing factor of the explosion in the illegal alien population in the US. The illegal population here is at an all-time high. There should never have been a healthcare mandate. This isn't a socialist regime. The people (or at least the majority of us) don't like the mandates, individual or business. I assert that you condoned Fast-N-Furious because you're the one who said things are better than they were \"under the misery of Bush\". Businesses salivated at the prospect of cheap labor, so when Bill Clinton signed NAFTA into law they didn't mind one bit firing millions of employees -many of whom had to seek any type of welfare they could in order to get by. Not good for economy ...","commenter_a":"You are MOST WELCOME here in the great state of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Mr. Trump!! I cannot WAIT to see you tomorrow!!
