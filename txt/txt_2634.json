I've been to Africa many times, I've spoken to hundreds of Africans.....they will rot and die in poverty because of the black government that runs the countries....take a very close look at who's in charge of America now!!! Except in America the white tax payer affords you the life you don't even deserve.....and now he's giving your life...yes your life to illegals...he's done with you....make the best of it...because that stupid monkey president couldn't care less about you!!!!","commenter_a":"Hell No. There are no more minorities","post_message":"Huffington Post:  Deserve Safe Spaces Without White People  A couple of weeks ago, two students from Ryerson University Journalism program were barred from attending an event organized by the ' BECAUSE THEY WERE WHITE!  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1226004427434976","commenter_b":"Get rid of her please","commenter_a":"Anyone else would have been fired.","post_message":"Do you think The View should be CANCELLED from TV?"},{"comment_id":"1021126491243474","commenter_b":"And yet a student did intervene verbally and is still alive.","commenter_a":"Shame on that teacher for not standing up for that student.

Men have been using the men's room and women have been using the ladies room without an issue since forever without any problems. My point is that the law allows for men to use the ladies room and women to use the men's room, that is the basis of this law.","commenter_a":"I want to know why this is such a \"hateful\" law. The \"party of science\" is arguing against a law that basically says \"You know this restroom that's for boys/men? Only boys/men can use it. You know this bathroom that's for girls/women? It's only for girls/women\". So you think if women feel uncomfortable that a man that says \"Hey, I feel like a woman\" goes into a woman's locker room must hate LGBT people? Really? It's not the trans people I'm concerned about. It's the people POSING as trans people. Why should women be made to feel uncomfortable just so a man that thinks he's a woman can use the women's restroom/bathroom? Wanting people to use the bathroom of the sex they were BORN with (and actually STILL are, as science dictates) does NOT = hate.","post_message":"After nationwide outcry about North Carolina's harmful anti-LGBT law, Gov.
