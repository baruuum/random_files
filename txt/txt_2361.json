Mmmmhhhhm I'm not gonna share on your walls but for those who have children, think of what type of democracy will enable if Sanders or Clinton both Democrat are elected president. To have too share the taxes you earn back for the benefit of others. Don't be naive because a lot abuse the system, which means if you want universal health care and benefits.. The Republican Party has to amend the laws of drug test issued for anyone wanting freebies and living off the cheese the government provides.. Which is I THE TAX PAYER.
