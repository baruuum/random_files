Who the hell do you think are working the lowest paying jobs that without them this country would not function. Will any of you go clean toilets for 6 dollars an hour (that's if they can get that much). NO!!! Would any of you go to the orange fields and go pick oranges for hours in over 98 plus degree weather for pennies a bag. HELL NO!!! But you like when you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for orange juice. If there were to be no illegal immigrants the costs of a lot of things people enjoy would sky rocket because the company would have to pay out more for employees passing the increase on to the consumer!!!!!! Everyone needs to back off immigrants because unless your ...","post_message":"There have been many to come out against Trump after his comments on illegal immigration, but one beloved politician just did exactly the opposite.

I'm no scientitian, but it seems to me it's a helluva coincidence (that we take for granted) that the female menstrual cycle is in line with the lunar cycle. Our bodies are 2/3rds water and the moon controls the tides. Am I talking out my ass if I suggest maybe the moon can can influence the fluids in our bodies? So on a dfferent planet, with different moons (and presumably after having been there for several generations), would women cycle differently?","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10154786679373984","commenter_b":"What a shame that this ladies after so many many years will fall for Hillary's BS and the press that are now panicking cause things are getting worse to them and the campaign.
