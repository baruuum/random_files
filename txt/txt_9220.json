That also could be their groceries for the month. When I worked at Walmart I would see carts like that and see that a lot of people would buy their monthly groceries at one time. So if you broke the cart down into 4 it really wouldn't be that much.","post_message":"This man noticed a difference between his cart and one in front of him in line at the checkout.

And he never filed for personal bankruptcy, it was a few of his companies out of a thousand. He's a billionaire, yet Rubio has trouble paying credit cards.
