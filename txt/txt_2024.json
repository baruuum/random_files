I agree we need to have background checks, but they take a while and that's why they risk their lives to find work and live better lives here. Why would an illegal want to just cross the border to cause havoc? They're here to work. An illegal Mexican can just do that all at home with the money they can make from drug cartel business. Like I said, it doesn't matter where you're from, there is bad in every nation and continent across the world. Even Antarctica. Some penguins are not nice birds.","commenter_a":"Personally, I've lived here my whole life in AZ. I've had more problems with the snow birds than the illegals. Last major bill before 1070 was bullshit. They wasted tax money trying to justify denying EMS to illegals when their own research showed a $240 million dollar surplus brought in by taxes and other monies by illegal immigrants in '06-- even after accounting for the expenditure of 'caring' for them. Here's a thought, how bought we reform and streamline the citizenship process so that people who want to be here and are willing to work here can actually do so and not wait 10 years to get citizenship.","post_message":"For Arizonans, immigration isn't just a campaign issue.
