So it's harder to kill. If it's bad, I agree with shaving the head. It's hair. It will grow back. On average hair grows an inch per month.

Bernie applied as a conscientious objector in the Vietnam war and did until he was too old to be drafted. In July 1985, Bernie Sanders traveled to Nicaragua, where he attended an event that one wire report dubbed an -U.S. rally. In 1981, he won a shocking victory by only 10 votes to become mayor of Vermont largest city, Burlington. Sanders was elected on a socialist platform and led a mayoral administration that he boasted was radical than any other in the country. And he had a vision! Sanders believed his work in Burlington could spread socialism throughout America. In April 1985, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy interview with Sanders in which he outlined his plan to spark change. That is exactly what he is trying to do now. Show a tiny bit of his plan and drastically change America ...","post_message":"Back-to-back poll results suggest that Hillary Clinton is on the cusp of a pivotal victory that would help her regain momentum after a string of embarrassing defeats and that would deliver a blow to Bernie Sanders as the two Democrats gear up for the final stretch of voting."},{"comment_id":"1106399449450800","commenter_b":"Have you ever been fired or refused a job because you had a cough?!
