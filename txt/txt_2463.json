I am an immigrant to this country and I have no intention of imposing my way of life on every person living here or subjugating the \"indigenous\" people of this land. I think I can speak for the vast majority of immigrants in saying that they also do not intend to do so. Most immigrants integrate into society. Perhaps you just don't like the way they look like.

But guess what, immediately these terrorist got training and weapons they starts killing their masters Americans and allies. Then the next day their X masters will come out with a BLANK SPEECH called War on Terror. Well am never gona be part of any War on terror coz I never creat any terrorist.
