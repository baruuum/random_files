They want to raise the gas tax, they want to introduce a milage tax. Who will this hurt the most? The pood and middle class. The Democrats don't care about the poor and middle class, they view them as cannon fodder. And uninformed people keep voting for them.","post_message":"The Obama administration and this Dem like the idea of using taxpayer dollars to study... new ways to tax people.

The GOVERNMENT is taking advantage of illegals and will NEVER get rid of them lmfao. People such as yourself must educate yourselves on the topic. In which, may i add, you know nothing about. Furthermore, illegals PAY taxes which INCLUDE medicare and social security. The government KNOWS that they are working under Americans social security numbers and even submit them ALONG with their real name and address to apply for an ITIN number. This allows them to PAY taxes even though they are in fact illegal. And guess what??? They will NEVER alert the American that their social is being used, these \"illegals\" will NEVER see a dime of social security benefits Nor will YOU!! And oh ya....they CANT apply for medicare / welfare either. And WHY would the government not tell you your social is being used?? ...","commenter_a":"The question is why are illegals getting benefits instead of being deported. No longer should illegals receive benefits from our tax dollars. I read earlier our social security funds have been used for illegals benefits. I for one sure didn't pay into social security so a non citizen could receive these benefits.","post_message":"\"The American taxpayers have reached a boiling point.

We fucking told you so, America. We said this, and it happened. For the record it doesn't feel good, and the vast majority of us wish harder than anything that we could have been wrong about this. No one is gloating; we're pissed.","post_message":"Supporters of Bernie Sanders never got their chance to prove if their candidate could have defeated now President-elect Donald J. Trump."}]
