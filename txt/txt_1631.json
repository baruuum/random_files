Like the disgusting and outrageous language championed by Donald Trump, this legislation paints all immigrants as “criminals and rapists.”  Local law enforcement officials, domestic violence groups, immigrants’ rights groups, mayors, faith leaders and labor groups all oppose the 'Donald Trump Act.' This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe, and it certainly does nothing to address our broken immigration system."},{"comment_id":"1001645919925097","commenter_b":"why don't she shut the f up and leave","commenter_a":"Open her mouth.","post_message":"Rosie O'Donnell isn't qualified to ___________."},{"comment_id":"10153635432868690","commenter_b":"Its not and has never been your land. You have no heritage nor history there except at best been that of tenant felaheens the Ottomans brought to milk the land for them or at worst; as more than half of you people are, illegal immigrants from the surrounding Arab states who flooded the land from the 1920s to 1940s as migrant workers and mujahideen who came to steal the land from the Jews. That your right of return better get its head swivelled to the Arab states. Besides, the Jews you ran out of the Arab states also has the keys to their doors and need their properties you stole and their own right of return.","commenter_a":"You will return and all Muslims will pray in Israhell won't last more than a decade","post_message":"'For Palestinians to give up the Right of Return- even those who have no intention of ever returning - is to acknowledge that we are lesser beings; that kicking us out of our homes and ripping our hearts out was okay. It is to affirm that we do not deserve our own history and heritage; that it was okay for our proud parents and grandparents to wither in the ashes of their memories inside refugee camps unfit for animals.'  Palestinian novelist Susan Abulhawa explores the meaning of the Right of Return."},{"comment_id":"814574258686460","commenter_b":"The ladies of The View were rude and disrespectful. It seems like they only invited you on the show to badger you. Whoopi is worse than Bill O'Reilly. She kept interrupting you & would not let you get your point across, and Joy just laughed at everything you said like it was some kind of a joke. They don't care about their guests' viewpoints at all. I have to say that I admire you for being the great person that you are.","commenter_a":"Thank you, Dr. Carson, for remaining the gentleman you are while on The View today. I must say I stopped watching that show years ago. I watched today because you were on. I have great respect and admiration for you. Donald Trump is not my first choice for President. I will vote for him if he is the Republican nominee. Maybe some of your calmness, thinking before you speak, will rub off on Donald if he is nominated and elected President. The women of The View are not my cup of tea. I turned the show off as soon as your segment was over.","post_message":"I would like to thank the Ladies of The View for having me on. Though we disagree on politics, the beautiful thing about America is that we're able to have platforms where we can discuss those differences. I will continue to work hard to ensure that this remains for generations to come."},{"comment_id":"861173230647951","commenter_b":"She is crazy","commenter_a":"Just 12 years?
