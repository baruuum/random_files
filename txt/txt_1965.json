Planned Parenthood is doing a service that they are legally allowed to preform because there are women choosing to have those services done. Christians have no right do insist this be stopped just because of their religious beliefs. I'm sick of Christianity being all high and mighty thinking that it is the end all be all of decision making for everyone else on the planet. Not everyone is a Christian and not everyone must be.

Your religious organization doesn't pay taxes yet you're complaining about the money spent on abortions.

In addition, you believe that your Christianity should trump my rights as a woman and you should decide what I should do with my body because of what your bible says. Well, I'm telling you NO!! Abortion is legal and its going to stay that way because of people like you.
