I teach them to keep their hands to themselves. When they're old enough to date, they'll be taught not to touch a woman unless invited. We shouldn't have to tell girls how to not get raped. We should be teaching our boys to not rape.","commenter_a":"When I was becoming old enough to go to parties as a teenager my mother started giving me the heads up about how to act when I went to out. One of the things she taught me was never drink so much that you lose control of yourself, watch who you accept drinks from, don't go to rooms with beds with men, etcetera. I'm curious as to what other mothers tell their daughters? And as a mother of sons around this age I wonder why the guy gets charged with rape if they're both drunk? Doesn't seem quite right to me.","post_message":"Former Tigers pitcher Evan Reed has been sentenced to probation after accepting a plea in his assault case.
