Those are not just mare refugees those are economic migrants that seek to invade Europe and it's borders in order to establish themselves on our continent! They are not here because they need help, they are not here because they are running from War, those are people that abandoned their country , their women and children in order to Exploit Our achievements. To Abuse our LAWS in order to gain access to benefits we have worked for decades! They do not seek help nor assistance nor do they want to return to their country after the War ends. They want to Infiltrate our culture , our lands and when they gain critical mass we will not be able not only to stop them but to even contain them and make them obey the Laws in the countries they live in.

If you have a job there and have a family they (McDonald's) and us (people that will take the hit of a min wage increase because the cost of products will go up) should not have to pay for your poor choices for not being mature and either going to college or tech school or working your way up in a company.

My Mom (bless her soul) was very inept with her money and defaulted on her student loans. Her SS WAS garnished. 15% came out every month. Luckily she lived with me so she was OK. We calculated what she owed and what was taken from her...... tax refunds and garnishes..... she paid that loan over and above YEARS before. But, they are like the IRS they charge interest for every day, week, month and SECOND you owe them money. I told my daughter, it's better to work and pay as you go and maybe take a few years longer to get an education than EVER take a loan for it.","commenter_a":"So what has Obama and the DNC been doing about this?","post_message":"How absurd! The very rich get richer and receive giant tax breaks, while low-income seniors see their social security benefits cut to pay off decades old student debt. We should be expanding social security benefits, not punishing seniors for the \"crime\" of getting a higher education. Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a crystal clear example as to why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities. In the richest country on earth, we should make life easier for seniors, not hard"}]
