My family and I aren't afraid because they did it the right way when coming over, they obeyed the law! No matter what ones last name is we are all immigrants, but there is a difference between immigrants and illegal immigrants. So sad that many people people don't realize the difference like yourself.","commenter_a":"What part do you all not understand or haven't read??? She entered the United States illegally November 2015!!!! Judge ordered her out of the US on January 26th. She broke the law!!! Yes it's sad that she MAY have a brain tumor but even the doctors have said they aren't for sure that it's cancerous. Doctors have cleared her medically to be discharged from the hospital in a stable condition! She had a medical episode on February 11th but once again got discharged from the hospital! So what makes this case \"non humane\" that you all speak of?!?!? She has broken the law, she has gotten medical help and was released from a medical team outside the detention center. Nothing inhumane going on!","post_message":"An undocumented 26-year-old woman from El Salvador who has a brain tumor was moved from a hospital to an ICE detention center in Texas."},{"comment_id":"10153430470412217","commenter_b":"Oh no no no....this woman is only about herself. My America would be a disaster if this witch were to gain the presidency. She is a fake and a phoney. She lies more then she tells the truth. She thinks our rules don't apply to her.

Do you think the Obama administration is out of control?"},{"comment_id":"978977272143131","commenter_b":"I agree. That's a spot on observation. I never thought about that, but it's true. Many feminine topics make people uncomfortable. Whether it be hygiene, sexuality, or social treatment. All common topics for comedy.","commenter_a":"Honestly, I think a lot of the reason men don't find women funny, is because men AND women are trained to see things from a man's perspective. I can hear a boner story and laugh my ass off because I can imagine what they are telling me and it's amusing. So much of what women comedians talk about are things that men feel they can't relate to - they've never thought about most things from a women's perspective. Just my two cents though...","post_message":"First it sounds ridiculous. Then you get it. Then it's hilarious and sad all at the same time. - Eric March"}]
