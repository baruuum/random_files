If it's so great in Cuba, why do we still have Cuban refugees fleeing to the US? Could it possibly be due to the oppressive Marxist-Leninist Castro regime? Leftist fools admire their heroes, communist revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Patterson should stick to writing novels.","commenter_a":"So go live there James......it's called socialism, or communism.

They broke the law so that makes them a criminal..and as for pushing...the illegals are the ones that are not going to like the results.. You come to the U.S. legally and you are welcome with open arms. Illegals come here by breaking the law and then refuse to learn English and then demand they be given the same rights as American citizens and for things to be changed to fit them...BS!!!!","commenter_a":"This is complete BS!!! They are illegals!! NOT undocumented.... In Oklahoma you have to prove you are here LEGALLY, not an illegal criminal to get an Oklahoma ID or DL. Sign up for a DL as an illegal and get deported.","post_message":"An Oklahoma City grassroots effort to get undocumented immigrants drivers licenses is gaining momentum."}]
