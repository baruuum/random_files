Smh","commenter_a":"My son-in-law, a sheriff's deputy, once got a call about a baby in a car seat in a car in the parking lot of a \"gentlemen club\" translation - strip club!! The cops found the father inside getting a lap dance. He was supposed to be caring for his child while his wife, a doctor, worked the night shift at the hospital.

I think those \"on the fence\" folks will be the factor in the next election not the lemmings who accept whatever is feed to them. My optimism is shaky but I'm hopeful.","commenter_a":"I say, keep it up. Most people will see this for what it is .. a transparent attempt to stop Hillary from becoming President. Anyone who watched the hearing knows she was poised and presidential unlike the GOP committee members. Gowdy was an unknown laughing stock but not he's a famous one.","post_message":"In trying to save his committee and his reputation, Trey Gowdy is now saying that Hillary was the whole problem, rather than admitting that this 'investigation' is a sham.

People will no longer abuse welfare and will actually get up and find a job.","post_message":"Arizona's Legislature cut $4 million from the budget by reducing the maximum time you can be on welfare from 5 years to 1 year. Critics say that it will cut funding for those who need it and can't find jobs. Supporters say it will encourage more to get off welfare and find work.
