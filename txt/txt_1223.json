Statistically speaking illegal immigrants will vote Democrat.. This is another reason why they do not want voter ID... It is not racist to want voter ID... everyone carries an ID.. Again a narrative from the left, In 10-15 years will we will be a one party country... We will also have a single-payer system, so get in line and prepared to wait for your doctor because you are now dealing with the government which is like dealing with the department of motor vehicles.. We will also have 500,000 more Syrian refugees in this country, A pay for play with Soros, she is a puppet for him... All of our tax dollars will have to pay for these refugees and all of the entitlement programs, along with all of the illegal immigrants in the country currently... We are on our way to socialism, open ...","commenter_a":"Well, in the next three days you will see our crooked media , led by CNN and NBC , run all the dirt they can dream up on Trump and absolutely nothing negative on Hillary despite all the information. It's our last chance to get rid of corrupt Washington insiders like the Clintons.

Socialism is when you have a garden with beautiful tomatoes and I, being too lazy to grow a garden, get my share of your tomatoes. Not because I deserve them, because the government said you have to give them. How ling do you think you will continue to grow that garden to feed my lazy butt? Socialism fails because the workers quit working also because there is no reward to their labor. The workers will become the lazy also and there will be no tomatoes. Figured I had better break it down to kindergarten level for you.","commenter_a":"If you support sanders, go live in Cuba.

Where I grew up the 'N' word was used frequently. Every time I was called that I retaliated. Im not a thug or a criminal. The teacher has to respect the students and vice versa. In hindsight the student should have went to the principal and then to his parents. Im in no way condoning what the student did but its a 2 way street. Dont bash the student when we dont know exactly what rhe teacher said. Racial slurs or any other forms of racism has no place in society. My kids or the kids I coach cant even say anything like that. Either way whatever was said isn't the problem. It was the lack of respect from the teacher and STUDENT.","commenter_a":"'@username you say teachers need to watch what they say. I don't get it. What about the child. Dosen't he need to be taught. I don't like what you said so I punch you. There are other ways of handling verbal abuse.
