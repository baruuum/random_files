People came from other towns and cities with food and other things that were badly needed during this time. I understand these ladies went above and beyond and for that I applaud them. But we should not forget all the other people that helped and are still here helping. While the kids are a very important part of our community there are still people working to rebuild what has taken them a lifetime to obtain. I just want to thank all the people who were here when we were at our worst.","commenter_a":"Very cool","post_message":"WATCH: Educators in Lumberton, NC, hit hard by Hurricane Matthew, get $50,000, a brand new playground and funds to rebuild 16 parks! @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1353803527975767","commenter_b":"Lock there asses up!","commenter_a":"Lol look how racist worded the article.

Away and actually they checked on the children throughout the night. It is said the mother visits the place where the child went missing to walk the streets hoping to find her. The parents are devastated over the loss. Just because you or I would not leave our children like this doesn't mean we should be so critical or unkind. They made a terrible mistake ( in this case perhaps a deadly one). We should show kindness and pray for them. I mean after all what if it were you/me. No one is beyond making mistakes. They are tortured enough. Walk a mile in their shoes.","post_message":"Based on an examination of the bones, Australian police determined the child was killed \"some time since the start of 2007\" â€“ the same year Madeleine McCann disappeared."},{"comment_id":"1121552027901325","commenter_b":"@username What percentage of women are voting for Hillary only because she is not a man??
