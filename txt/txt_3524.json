They have nothing to offer our citizens but hatred & fraud. Neither Russia nor China could have planned it better. These evil people have taken a strong, compassionate country & turned into the laughing stock of the rest of the free world. All they really want is to have us pay for & die for their desire to make war all the time. It's time we figured out that these \"straight\" (maybe) white men are truly impotent & can only declare their\"manliness\" by making war on everyone rlse, including you & I. If there is such a thing as the \"anti-Christ\", it has come in the form of the Teapublicans, not just one person. They are sickening & digusting.","post_message":"Too true.

Mmmmhhhhm I'm not gonna share on your walls but for those who have children, think of what type of democracy will enable if Sanders or Clinton both Democrat are elected president. To have too share the taxes you earn back for the benefit of others. Don't be naive because a lot abuse the system, which means if you want universal health care and benefits.. The Republican Party has to amend the laws of drug test issued for anyone wanting freebies and living off the cheese the government provides.. Which is I THE TAX PAYER.
