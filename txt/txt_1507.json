What I am pointing out is that EVERY SINGLE POLL gives him a much wider lead over Trump than Hillary's lead. Most importantly in swing states. Who cares that Hillary won most of the Southern states, they are not going blue. Bernie won in most of the swing states and he polls dramatically better than her over Trump in those states. He may be losing the primaries, it is probable even. However if the point of this article is that Trump is such a threat to the presumptive Democratic nominee and we need to not be distracted by the primaries than it is fair to say, who is the better candidate to defeat Trump? Maybe for the sake of unity and defeating Trump, Hillary should bow out. You know, for the common good.","commenter_a":"I think we need to start asking the question is it time for Clinton to bow out of the race. Because if our main yardstick is not letting Trump be president all the polls are pretty clear, Sanders is our best bet.","post_message":"Yet Bernie Sanders is having none of it, frequently telling the thousands of supporters who attend his rallies that he still has a narrow path to the nomination."},{"comment_id":"1020979627937496","commenter_b":"@username you shouldn't talk about yourself and Justin that way, asscrack. Ohhh she's not American so her music sucks? You and people like you are the reason this place sucks so much. God forbid you have to hear something that doesn't cater to you! Try really sacrificing for something worthwhile other than greedy politicians and your bank accounts and egos. Half of this country doesn't believe in the armed forces and government any more for good reason. Sacrifice my asshole, you don't know what sacrifice and hardship are until you've been homeless and still given things up for others. You know why people go into the armed services, most of them? They're too fucking lazy and/ or stupid to figure out something else on their own and sheep need the direction of wolves.","commenter_a":"If you've never heard the language before, don't insult and call it gibberish.
