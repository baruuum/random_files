Plus, people just didn't vote in the primaries enough. It was a simple matter of numbers. But he's still out there and I'm hopeful for 2020!","commenter_a":"i was a die hard Bernie supporter, but I would like to know the truth. Was Bernie placed in the primaries to gain the young vote knowing he would drop out only to hopefully hand the votes over to Hillary. Was he truly conspired against by the DNC or as this post says why didn't he stand up to his constituents? What went wrong Bernie, can you please tell the ones who like me, wrote you in on the ballot even though you weren't registered aS a write in. Your true believers.","post_message":"If you don't have the guts to face your constituents, you shouldn't be in the United States Congress. If you need police at the town hall meetings, that's fine, have police at the meetings, have security at the meetings. But don't use that as an excuse to run away from your constituents after you support repealing the Affordable Care Act, doing away with protections for pre-existing conditions. If you're going to do all those things, answer the questions your constituents have."},{"comment_id":"10153157400746130","commenter_b":"I gained a lot of weight on women food.","commenter_a":"Savanna Bailey","post_message":"\"I quickly learned that food 'for women' just isnâ€™t enough food.
