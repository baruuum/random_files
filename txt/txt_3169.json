I am not a fan of any of these idiots running. But Trump has got to go . People are gonna get hurt, innocent people. Look at the monsters he has as his security detail that will swing at anyone for no reason and now this with his supporters. The media has to stop covering him. Take away all the attention he is getting. Maybe cover him when something intelligent comes out of his mouth, which so far has been nothing. This man can say whatever he want but we are a democracy, we have a government and he rant about all he wants to do but he can't do it alone. There are 3 branches of government. I know that he has veto power but then we would be calling him Dictator Trump not President Trump. He is a egotistical classless piece of shit.","post_message":"It's getting worse."},{"comment_id":"892287504157347","commenter_b":"America is lost. We haven't won a war since 1945. When did it start?

Harry S Truman was our Democrat president. We are losing peeps! You are getting your welfare checks, but for how much longer? We have aborted away our labor and armed forces.
