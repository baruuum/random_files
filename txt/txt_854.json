Congratulations you got video of her stopping and starting over and over, all the while you are driving in wet conditions with one hand, with a child in the car??? Plus this crazy lady could have gotten out WITH a gun and killed the woman driving and the child. People need to just let road raged people go. Just pull off to another road or whatever, get a tag number and call 911. Leave it to the authorities. She should be thankful for her life.","commenter_a":"I'm glad the nut case was turned in and charged.","post_message":"It's the video everyone is talking about.

Regardless of how prepared you are for anything, the ocean is unpredictable as well as man. Anything could have occurred. Rouge wave, pirates, drug runners, etc. Either way it must be Hell on that family right now as you start to wonder \"what if\"? From one parent to another that has lost a Son God Bless and I hope this story has a happy ending but it doesn't look good.
