Guess you've never heard of Italian-American, German-American, Polish-American or perhaps people celebrating their ethnic heritage. So apparently pride in one's ethnic origins is not extended to Black Americans. What is the name Rush? English? I'm betting someone in your family came over on the Mayflower? Proud of that? Why not? Apparently if you were taken against your will in irons on a slave ship you also lose your ability to take pride in your heritage as well?","commenter_a":"There is no such place as \"Africa-America\" therefore there is no such thing as an \"African-American\". They are either Americans or they are Africans. Not all blacks come from Africa and not all Africans are black.

However, one thing I do not share is the that even I am not American, not born here, you still don't get to say \"go back to China\" to me. I go where I want and I came here legally. America could be more friendly.","post_message":"An editor for The New York Times wrote an open letter to a woman who told him to \"go back to China.\" Asian-Americans responded by sharing their own racist moments using #thisis2016.
