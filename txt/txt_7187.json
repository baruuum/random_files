They should just remove the robes and wear clown outfits.","commenter_a":"Franklin Graham The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled today that same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states. With all due respect to the court, it did not define marriage, and therefore is not entitled to re-define it. Long before our government came into existence, marriage was created by the One who created man and womanAlmighty Godand His decisions are not subject to review or revision by any manmade court. God is clear about the definition of marriage in His Holy Word: a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24).

I like the season so far but guys, what happened to the people of Roanoke really isn't that big of a mystery. Most likely after part of the group left to get supplies more colonist died from a mix of starvation and attacks. They then most likely moved to settle with the Croatoan tribe for both help feeding themselves and protection. It also helps explain the upsurge in Croatoan children with blonde hair or other features that are rare, though not unheard of, in their genetic pool. Basically, your elementary school teacher lied to you. Other lies you learned in history class: the Mayans didn't just mysteriously disappear. They over farmed the valleys they lived in and could no longer continue to occupy large cities and began living in smaller groups.

There's other ways to find physical satisfaction than sexual intercourse & they won't create a baby. Abortion IS NOT a means of birth control. It's murder. For those who are for abortion as a woman's choice, what about the choice of all of those female babies that have been aborted?","post_message":"So true."},{"comment_id":"1112791138738235","commenter_b":"1 stupid bitch","commenter_a":"Unfortunately she is right more often than not.","post_message":""}]
