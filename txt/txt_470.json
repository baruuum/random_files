I translate that into, we will not get rid of our free labor (slaves) so secession was the choice, I can see where economics played into it, but to say slavery was not part of those same economics would be terribly ignorant. Lincoln maintained that secession was illegal thus unless south gave in war was inevitable.","commenter_a":"Here is an explanation of the civil war directly from the FEDERAL Government which proves without doubt that the War was NOT about slavery.

I don't even use public restrooms for myself if I can avoid let alone for my baby to eat in! If everyone wants to be politically correct then make a bottle fed baby eat in a restroom with a blanket over their heads too! That bottle nipple is replica of a mother's real nipple, for a REASON!","commenter_a":"It's okay to breastfeed in public. Its the way your doing it that offends people. If you're gonna breastfeed in public at least have some decency to have at least something to cover that part of your body and the baby while nursing. Simple but effective.","post_message":"A Connecticut woman is speaking out after posting a viral video in which she was yelled at by a man for breastfeeding her baby in Target."},{"comment_id":"10153839178821636","commenter_b":"What exactly is your barometer for being \"ruined\"? You realise Germany is one of the most successful countries in the world right? In terms of GDP, growth, economic viability, social mobility, lower wealth inequality, higher math and literacy, better education, lower incarceration and homicide rates, lower obesity, drug and alcohol addiction etc etc. If being among the top few countries in the world for such things is \"ruined\", you clearly don't know the meaning of the word. Put aside the right wing and sensationalist news outlets for a moment, who's job it is to highlight every transgression of migrants and Muslims, in order to make things seem much worse than they actually are, and instead take a minute to appreciate just how successful and dominant Germany is right now. Merkel is smart, she knows migration is the key to economic growth and sustainability, even if it has some negative byproducts. ...","commenter_a":"Merkel has not only ruined Germany with her idiotic open door fantasies, she has caused havoc for the rest of Europe.

Why isn't their team also punished? Wes Welker violated those rules with Denver. But it got retroactively sustained due to rule changes. Are you kidding?!?!","commenter_a":"In the end his punishment had nothing to do with deflated footballs. It was for behavior detrimental to the integrity of the game and the league.
