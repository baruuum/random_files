Trump 2016.","post_message":"Oh, now I see why Donald Trump lashed out today.    He got bad coverage in the NYTimes and research on the conservative voting base.  I just thought it was a typical trump circus non sequitur.  I hadn't seen this story until now.  I feel sorry for him.   It just isn't going to end well for him.  Maybe I am wrong but I just don't think the American conservative likes the bully act.  Is everyone who disagrees with him:  fat, ugly, stupid, loser or failing?  It is amazing to see anyone not in the Obama White House with an \"enemies list\" this large.  Be fore he ran for president he was always a nice hotelier to me and my family.     I said four weeks ago that I did not want him on the show as the only thing to be gained was fifteen minutes of ratings and seeing that my ratings have never been higher nor have my commercial rates been higher, I didn't feel it was worth the trade of integrity.  He is welcome on many talk radio shows.  Not mine.  I will stick with Cruz, Carson, Fiorina, Santorium, Paul and tomorrow Bobby Jindal.  My audience rates Donald Trump consistently in tenth place in the race.   We have spend the last 16 years learning about progressives.  My audience is not fooled.  @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153931656668812","commenter_b":"This is way out of context y'all all sound ignorant specially the one starting this comment","commenter_a":"Waiting to see who blames Obama or immigrants....","post_message":"Long Island town demolishes U.S. Navy veteran's home while he was in Florida recovering from a knee replacement: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10153871273143984","commenter_b":"go home and take obama with you !","commenter_a":"OMG.
