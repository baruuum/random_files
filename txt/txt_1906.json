To pretend they had no knowledge of it's origin is BS. They should be fined and held accountable. I lived across the street from this monument for two years and while the area does have its issues, there is no reason to bash Hartford. There is a multitude of beautiful and historical architecture to see in that area if you are willing to get out of your car. Many state and local residents have worked long and hard to have the Colt area designated as a National Park. This is a slap in the face to a city that is trying to restore some remnants of it's former glory. Take the tour - learn a little history and have an appreciation for some of the treasures in our own back yard.","post_message":"\"When I first saw it, it almost made you want to cry.\""},{"comment_id":"934633189910873","commenter_b":"Ah, Danielle, so you had the choice because of feminists who paved the way for you to do so.","commenter_a":"It user to be Matt but anymore it's just crazy man hating women destroying family dynamics in this country. I believe in equality, rights and fair treatment of all. Men, women, and all races, but I'm not a feminist. I support my family the best way I can now which is to stay home and take care of them. My children are smarter and safer with me here, plus they have a structured living environment. I plan on getting a p/t job when they both start full time school but as for now this is where I'm needed. And I love every minute of it even the hard days.","post_message":"Ellen Page has a point here, ya know...
