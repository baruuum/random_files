That is the money that gets spent back into the economy. When you have the top 1% getting money, they spend 5-10% of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend 100-110% of what they earn. Since we are a consumer economy this will be good for business in the long term. Not for the people getting the $15 per hour.","post_message":"An economist explains why Clintonâ€™s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 might be 'too much, too quickly.'"},{"comment_id":"10153843599995796","commenter_b":"@username - did white privilege cause 360,000 Union soldiers to die fighting to free the slaves?","commenter_a":"Black lives matter is a racist (by definition) organization funded by George Soros to spread a false narrative, agitate and wreak havoc.
