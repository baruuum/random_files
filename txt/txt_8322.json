Big problem in our country is young girls are getting pregnant, guys leaving, single mom/hard to get education, etc ----> leads to broken family structures/children not raised properly---> leading to most problems we are facing in our country","commenter_a":"She didn't have sex, she had intercourse, or made love. Her sex is female. Why must we depersonalize coitus, to like farting or blowing your nose?? Let's put the LOVE back into making love, then our kids might make the connection to a loving act that sometimes leads to pregnancy. It's supposed to belong to people who are committed not a spectator sport or a recreational past time. :)","post_message":"She handled them pretty well though."},{"comment_id":"1070629882958022","commenter_b":"Look mr.

So many people are making lame excuses for these kids! They were old enough to be out by themselves with no supervision,THEY MADE THE DECISION to do what they did,which KILLED PEOPLE and DESTROYED HOMES !! I hope the deaths and destruction is imbedded in their minds FOREVER !!! Bad choice of a way to spend your day ya little F***ERS !!!","commenter_a":"As a child a friend and I were playing with fire in a field. We accidentally set a huge bush on fire that could have easily spread out of control had we not had a drink with us. By the grace of god it didn't spread to all the near by homes. We were not trying to burn people's homes down. I think people need to realize that kids don't always think of what could happen. They are children! They will have this on them for the rest of their lives.","post_message":"Two minors have been arrested and accused of starting wildfires that killed 14 people in eastern Tennessee."},{"comment_id":"843269965740273","commenter_b":"How do you know it's a woman?","commenter_a":"It's so sad to see how judgmental people are. Opinions are like belly buttons. Everyone has one and they're filled with lint. To call this woman names and degrading her by calling her IT, is shameful. Not everyone lives inside the box or mold of society. \"Free your mind, and the rest will follow!\"","post_message":"Today's culture is damn sickening.
