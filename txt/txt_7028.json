However what is the most humane way to cull them.. A bullet is best but only if you are a very good shot as a wounded fox can take days to die. Poisoning is also a slow death. Trapping is just as bad as they can take days to die or try and chew off their own paws. So it looks like there is no easy answer, and no we cannot just let them breed indiscriminately without some control as you would understand if you saw the havoc they can cause especially in the lambing season.","post_message":"\"Fox hunting is a pursuit from the past and like the overwhelming majority of the population I believe that is where it should stay, consigned to history.\""},{"comment_id":"1571786566441790","commenter_b":"What good will it do, congress passes these laws.","commenter_a":"These people make me sick.","post_message":"These welfare abusers need to be taught a lesson.
