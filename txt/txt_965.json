Not one illegal should be in this country. Trump is spot on. If you were in someone's house with a fake ID you would be charged with breaking and entering and impersonation and sent to jail.

Glad we got that straightened out. \"I've known of kids getting suspend from school for praying before they ate lunch\" If that actually happened, the school involved broke the law. \"Employees were not allowed to say Merry Christmas it was happy holidays. She told me that.\" Right, because saying \"happy holidays\" is more inclusive. Of course, while not on the job, she was completely allowed to say \"Merry Christmas\" to her heart's content. \"There has been a huge change in this country for the last 25 years of Christianity being slowly phased out by our government.\" Not really. Christianity has never been part of our government, since it's not supposed to be. The first amendment makes that clear.","commenter_a":"I guess this is another step on kicking God out of this country.","post_message":"Indiana city renames Good Friday \"Spring Holiday\" to be more inclusive"},{"comment_id":"10153898443761770","commenter_b":"In GOD we TRUST....Vote for Trump/Pence 2016..Hillary hate guns because dangerous to the toddlers!!!

Anti-discrimination law always trumps Religious freedom law, especially when discrimination is not explicitly addressed, as if the case for RFRA laws. If this was an attempted to legalize discrimination, the analogy would be like a man throwing a feather at a door to force it open. It is a sad attempt. 2) This is not religion being forced down your throat. It is religious liberty. Perhaps, it bothers you that a man would be allowed to wear long hair in an office that requires a clean cut, or that the Amish would not be forced to \"drive\" a minimum speed limit, but it hardly qualifies as religion being forced down one's throat, in my opinion. 3) This is merely a copy of the federal law with some of the ...","commenter_a":"I'm tired of Pence and all his follower's trying to \"defend\" him.
