Go stand near the them who lost legs. Listen to the stories of the PTSD stricken. Then come speak this hunger for war. I took an oath to support and defend this constitution.

Defending our country has been my lifelong business, but I won't say it's been without questioning where the profit is going! Re-read Sodom and Gomorrah.

He doesn't give a rats ass about any of them at all whatsoever. He would structure tax laws and policies that would for their benefit him once he left the White House if he ever made it to presidency. And all those morons who voted for him would sit there with their asses handed to them.","post_message":"LOL! Somewhere, Pres. Obama is rolling on the floor with laughter!
