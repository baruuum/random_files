The terror experienced in Paris for one night is what they go through on a day to day basis and you want to send them away? Have some empathy, what if it was you and your child fleeing this barbarism? Turning them away is no better than away Jewish refugees during WW2 (see SS St. Louis). How anyone can see their suffering and simply ignore it or tell them to leave defies any and all tenants of a Christian faith, humanity, and what America stands for.","post_message":"How very Christian of them."},{"comment_id":"10153544457476509","commenter_b":"Thanks","commenter_a":"Why are animals doing what animals do all of a sudden national news?","post_message":"What a catch!

I would have not wanted them to go but if I had a daughter which I don't I would not want her to be drafted and put in the position of getting captured. It is bad enough what they do to men when captured you can imagine what they would do to women before doing to them what they do to men. I do now have a grand daughter and a grandson. I hope neither of them ever have to go thru a war. I also hope everyone else's kids don't either.","post_message":"The Senate voted this week to require women to register for the draft.
