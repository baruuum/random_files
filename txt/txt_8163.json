Elderly people do not belong on the road. NOW before you idiots talk crap let me just tell you my father drove until he was 87 years old. When my brother and I reported him to the DMV at 83 years of age he was sly. He just went and took his drive test at the Silverton branch of the DMV and passed because all they had him do was drive around the block. Regardless, old people need to be allowed to ride the buss and max for free and stay out from behind the wheel!!.","post_message":"Police say nobody was injured in the crash, however there was something very familiar about it for everyone involved."},{"comment_id":"1239601439418363","commenter_b":"kill yourself then you basic bitch","commenter_a":"yo this shit is funny as fuck and if you disagree you're definitely not lit kill yourselves if you didn't laugh when the girl dialed 911 on the microwave and the first few notes of the x-files theme song plays as you hear the operator lmaoo im deaaaaaad if you didn't like this vid fuck u, ur bitch, ur fam, and the clique u claim","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"10153127033512383","commenter_b":"Draw the little snakes out","commenter_a":"Bring it!","post_message":"UNAFRAID: Troops remain defiant on social media in the wake of the recent threat against military personnel from the Islamic State group."},{"comment_id":"1241124305907597","commenter_b":"Mexicans R not the enemies!

They act like a strangers physical appearence directly affects them... If it does, then how pathetic are they?","commenter_a":"Whilst healthy living is undoubtedly a good thing, and being significantly overweight (or underweight) can be poor for one's health, making clothes that fit the diverse body shapes we have is not 'facilitating' an unhealthy lifestyle. It's simply ensuring that people of all body types and dimensions can dress in a style which they like, and in sizes which are comfortable and flattering to their shape. Besides, being overweight isn't as simple as being a 'lifestyle' - in many cases it can come from factors as diverse as metabolism, mobility issues, eating disorders or genuine dietary or medicine requirements.","post_message":"\"Saying that high-street stores shouldn’t “facilitate” certain human beings having access to clothing, in order to make them really understand how unacceptable they are as people, is pretty nasty, right?\""}]
