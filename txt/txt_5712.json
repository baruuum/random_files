She went thru 12 hours of gruesome testimonies with congressional republicans and didn't even break a sweat and was able to squash all of them like cockroaches. On the other hand, Donald Trump choked during a 1 hour meeting with the Mexican President and he choked and sweated bullets while being interviewed by Faux News Megan Kelly.","commenter_a":"Jordan Elum","post_message":"#Repost Ivanka Trump #Instagram ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Smooches from baby Theodore. üòò #Latergram"},{"comment_id":"522395871281301","commenter_b":"@username then tear it down and build bridges smh","commenter_a":"The wall was already built before he ever thought about becoming pope.

Sunglasses included. And how about we lower the surveillance cameras to head height so we can get a decent face picture instead of a grainy aerial shot. Why are we continually so bad at surveillance? Be whatever religion you want, but for everyone's public safety, we deserve to get a good look at you so we can quickly identify you later on.
