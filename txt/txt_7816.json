My mother died of ALS in June 1973 but was in the hospital and out many times and was never denied care. In fact she spent the last 3 months of her life in the hospital and had her nightly beer with my dad. Hopefully at some point in time they will get it figured out but sadly will probably not happen in my lifetime.","commenter_a":"That's exactly how they work. They deny, deny, deny until the person /family gives up hope. It is terrible how these people can get away with stealing/withholding money that these precious people put in and need.","post_message":"A few weeks ago, 11Alive shared the moving story of 42-year-old Melissa Kern. She had been battling ALS for almost a decade, and had reached a point where she could only move her eyelid to communicate. While she fought the disease, her husband Chris struggled to pay the bills, getting nothing from Social Security for disability benefits. Bill Liss 11Alive took on the case. They succeeded. Tragically, it was too late. See more: @webpagelink"}]
