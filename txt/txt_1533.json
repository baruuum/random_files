Question for Obama, if the wealthiest 1% is forced to pay their fair share as you say are they more likely to sacrifice their life style to pay the tax hike with or slash the payroll aka are jobs to pay for it ? And if given the choice between getting the rich to pay ( again as you say) their fair share or having a job to provide for my family, I'll take the latter every time!!","post_message":"This administration has failed to prioritize job creation and economic opportunity. The Washington culture may be fundamentally broken, but the American spirit that built this great nation is not. America's leaders should be working to ensure every person who wants a job, has a job. That’s what this is about – making sure mothers and fathers can provide for their families and our children have every opportunity to pursue their dreams. #SOTU"},{"comment_id":"10153724000373132","commenter_b":"Then she will have another kid.","commenter_a":"If she's stupid they will.

If we must be told of the killing, we are told they are necessary to defend the way and . Because U.S. life is subsidized worldwide (and within the United States by people of color and poor White labor), racism must exist or else the entire edifice crumbles... . Race is not only necessary, but also a central tenet of westward expansion, for Western imperialism and capitalism are intimately tied to White superiority' (Christopher Knaus 'More White Supremacy? The Lord of the Rings as Pro-American Imperialism' Multicultural Perspectives, 7(4), 54-58. 2005).","commenter_a":"'Who the United States considers to be evil is certainly not winning in reality. Poor, starving, bombed out women and children in Iraq and Afghanistan are not winning. The women working 16-hr workdays in sweat-shops in Thailand, the Philippines, Jamaica, and Mexico are not winning. The victims of human trafficking in New York, Florida, and Texas are not winning. Those with AIDS in Africa are not winning. The billions of poor people of color throughout the world are not winning. And yet we have set up an entire system of imperialized globalization, which we call democracy to keep them from winning. So we are, in fact, winning, although we only win because we have obscured not only what we are fighting for, but also whom we are fighting against' (Knaus).","post_message":"Question of the Day: Which Republican presidential candidate do you think will be the toughest on radical Islamists?"},{"comment_id":"10152804674496094","commenter_b":"Can't wait to put the clothesline back up...hard to hang dry all the time when you're in a deep freeze for several months of the year.","commenter_a":"Lets force them!","post_message":"Human beings are highly adaptable, but even in the face of climate change, many remain unwilling to do more than tweak their current lifestyles."},{"comment_id":"10155534707951509","commenter_b":"Hillary is going to prison, The wicked witch is dead.","commenter_a":"Black people don't vote for Hillary Clinton.
