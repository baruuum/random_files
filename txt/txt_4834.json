The GOVERNMENT is taking advantage of illegals and will NEVER get rid of them lmfao. People such as yourself must educate yourselves on the topic. In which, may i add, you know nothing about. Furthermore, illegals PAY taxes which INCLUDE medicare and social security. The government KNOWS that they are working under Americans social security numbers and even submit them ALONG with their real name and address to apply for an ITIN number. This allows them to PAY taxes even though they are in fact illegal. And guess what??? They will NEVER alert the American that their social is being used, these \"illegals\" will NEVER see a dime of social security benefits Nor will YOU!! And oh ya....they CANT apply for medicare / welfare either. And WHY would the government not tell you your social is being used?? ...","commenter_a":"The question is why are illegals getting benefits instead of being deported. No longer should illegals receive benefits from our tax dollars. I read earlier our social security funds have been used for illegals benefits. I for one sure didn't pay into social security so a non citizen could receive these benefits.","post_message":"\"The American taxpayers have reached a boiling point. We are tired of illegals taking American jobs. We are tired of illegals living off our tax dollars. We are tired of illegals causing mayhem in our streets,\" says Todd Starnes.

It's a free speech wall that can only be used for their personal agendas and things they agree with . Poor pansies. Oh and make sure the crisis team comes with their prescription pad.","post_message":"The Ohio University wall has been an outlet for free speech for more than 40 years.

Plus, people just didn't vote in the primaries enough. It was a simple matter of numbers. But he's still out there and I'm hopeful for 2020!","commenter_a":"i was a die hard Bernie supporter, but I would like to know the truth. Was Bernie placed in the primaries to gain the young vote knowing he would drop out only to hopefully hand the votes over to Hillary. Was he truly conspired against by the DNC or as this post says why didn't he stand up to his constituents? What went wrong Bernie, can you please tell the ones who like me, wrote you in on the ballot even though you weren't registered aS a write in. Your true believers.","post_message":"If you don't have the guts to face your constituents, you shouldn't be in the United States Congress. If you need police at the town hall meetings, that's fine, have police at the meetings, have security at the meetings. But don't use that as an excuse to run away from your constituents after you support repealing the Affordable Care Act, doing away with protections for pre-existing conditions.
