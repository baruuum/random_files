Think about it: End abortions, brings on many children that the parents can't care for (likely because of finances). The child likely grows up in poverty, being told (by the same people that ended abortions) he/she is a leech on society (parents likely getting assistance), so that child will grow up and most likely do one of two things (a few will take a different path, of course). 1) begin a criminal career 2) join the military to be fodder Republicans want to abort YOUR children when they are adults....THAT is why they want to end the termination of unwanted pregnancies.","commenter_a":"Attack on women!!!!!
