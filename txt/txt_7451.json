Anyone applauding a man loosing a fortune for standing up for his beliefs is soiling their own humanity. By ruining his life, you are staining your own soul. All of you are behaving much worse than anything you are accusing him of (falsely I might add). Those lambasting him are the ugly ones. I have seen much more vulgar behavior from the anti-trump crowd than anything that has been used as ammunition against him, true or not (most of it is false).","post_message":"The numbers say that Trump casinos, stores, and golf courses have suffered most."},{"comment_id":"10152658419777894","commenter_b":"Girl Bye!!

He also attacked the cops, that is clearly seen on video. White people who are drunk and high on drugs are beaten by the police when they resist arrest too... Please tell all the story of you are going to tell it. As for the Black Lives Matter movement goes, they just increase tension and stir things up. All Lives Matter, end of story. Where are the BLM protesters when two black kids are shot in their front yard in a gang-related shooting and there are no leads in the case? Nowhere. If a white police officer isn't involved, they don't care. They just want headlines, not community building. And that community is all of us, not just one ethnic group.","post_message":"Rodney King, an American taxi driver, was beaten by four LAPD officers after being caught speeding. He suffered a fractured facial bone, a broken right ankle and severe bruising and lacerations. It sparked a global conversation about police brutality; two of the officers were found guilty of violating King’s civil rights on April 16th 1993"}]
