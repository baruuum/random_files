If you see the pictures and videos, there are lounge chairs and tables just feet away from the water. People can read the \"no swimming\" sign, but an alligator is not going to think twice about coming on land. I think Disney needs to close off areas where there are gators. I lived in Tampa for four years, and gators were everywhere near water. You just knew where they were, and if you didn't, there were signs. I doubt people did not know about the alligators; you can always spot them especially if there are more than three. This could have been prevented.","commenter_a":"Why were alligators allowed to be so close to where human activity is?
