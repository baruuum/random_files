SILLY goose. SSSOOOO, are you saying that if a mentally retarded person is raped, then they should have the baby? Even though they don't have the mental capacity to care for themselves?.......... thats really stupid to state that they would have to go to another state in order for them to have an abortion, or to exclude ALL abortions. WOW. I bet you didn't consider mentally handicapped people being raped, or even 10 year olds. The youngest parents ever recorded, from my knowledge are the age of 10. Do you see the issue here? Think about it. Seriously. THINK people.","commenter_a":"TRUMPERS: Instead of saying get rid of abortion, why not use POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT by encouraging safe sex, and making birth control available in stores - WITHOUT HAVING TO GET A PRESCRIPTION.
