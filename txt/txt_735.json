The last thing he needs is anymore reason.. I don't miss the excess skin they removed from vag after giving birth. Wasn't doing me any good, and it would've been in the way.

Others were willing to issue the licenses.","post_message":"Today, judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny. Today, for the first time ever, the government arrested a Christian woman for living according to her faith. This is wrong. This is not America.  I stand with Kim Davis. Unequivocally. I stand with every American that the Obama Administration is trying to force to choose between honoring his or her faith or complying with a lawless court decision.  In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts rightly observed that the Court’s marriage decision has nothing to do with the Constitution. Justice Scalia observed that the Court’s decision was so contrary to law that state and local officials would choose to defy it.  For every politician — Democrat and Republican — who is tut-tutting that Davis must resign, they are defending a hypocritical standard. Where is the call for the mayor of San Francisco to resign for creating a sanctuary city — resulting in the murder of American citizens by criminal illegal aliens welcomed by his lawlessness?  Where is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws, our welfare reform laws, and even his own Obamacare?  When the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.  Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office. That is the consequence of their position. Or, if Christians do serve in public office, they must disregard their religious faith–or be sent to jail.  Kim Davis should not be in jail. We are a country founded on Judeo-Christian values, founded by those fleeing religious oppression and seeking a land where we could worship God and live according to our faith, without being imprisoned for doing so.  I call upon every Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis. Stop the persecution now."},{"comment_id":"10153095274501600","commenter_b":"JERK","commenter_a":"there needs to be an (unlike button)","post_message":"“We are entering the curvy girl era and when all eyes are on the bikini babes of Sports Illustrated, it would be a great time to have the conversation about the rise of the curvy girl,” a spokeswoman for Sports Illustrated said."},{"comment_id":"867191473393219","commenter_b":"'@username illegal.

Long before Trump ran for president i believed he is the man for the job. Smart, strong, dedicated and beyond all else brave enough to stand up for his vision and commitment, if anyone has what it takes to make change for the better it is Donald Trump. From all the way here in New Zealand - i have confidence in Donald Trump to clean up and create change.
