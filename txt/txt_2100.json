I'm a single mother and I was working full time and couldn't afford daycare or a full-time nanny and I did went to get help and they cover the daycare or babysitter cost...some people work half on the books and half off the books just so they can collect government help I see it every day...","commenter_a":"Is taking care of several under school age children not a full time job That mothers are not getting paid for.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the McDonald family. A former U.S. Navy hospital corpsman and third generation police officer, Steven McDonald was shot three times in the line of duty on July 12, 1986. The shooting left him quadriplegic. Several months after his injuries, he said that he had forgiven the 15 year-old who had shot him."}]
