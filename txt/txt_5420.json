What he said was \"supporters of the second amendment\" might have a way ....... meaning like the NRA's lobby could have a way to PROTECT AND KEEP THE SECOND AMENDMENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. AT NO TIME DID HE EVER SAY OR IMPLY THAT anyone be assassinated. AT NO TIME!!! When you report things that NEVER HAPPENED BY CHANGING WORDS AND ADDING WORDS, You really make yourselves look pathetic! WE ALL KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID and it isn't what your are saying. VERY unprofessional of your news staff to do that kind of stuff! You are as bad as Hillary Clinton saying she didn't say WHAT SHE SAID ON THE VIDEO WHICH PROVES WHAT SHE SAID, when the 4 men's coffins from Benghazi were being taken off the plane.

No one wanted them in the first place. Replace all the female flight attendants with young good-looking strippers. They don't even serve food anymore, so what's the loss. The strippers would at least triple the alcohol sales and get a \"party atmosphere\" going in the cabin. And, of course, every businessman in this country would start flying again, hoping to see naked women. Because of the tips, female flight attendants wouldn't need a salary, thus saving even more money. Muslims would be afraid to get on the planes for fear of seeing naked women. Hijackings would come to a screeching halt, and the airline industry would see record revenues. This is definitely a win - win situation if we handle it right -- a golden opportunity to turn a liability into an asset. Why didn't Bush or Obama think of this?
