He then gets in trouble because, as most 6 year old boys, he gets out of his seat and wiggles all day. But the kicker is what he's fed! Sugar sugar sugar for school breakfast! He's even come home and told me he had a freaking pop tart! What the crap! Then he's punished for their stupidity. Schools need to lay off the sugar, and allow for atleast 20 minutes for recess. I vote for 20 mins twice a day. My son would be SO much better for his teacher! (Oh, and I agree with many comments....get rid of this common core crap! It's just that....CRAP!!!)","post_message":"Do you think that Florida elementary schools should be required to provide 20 minutes of recess every day?"},{"comment_id":"10153308382443145","commenter_b":"How sad !
