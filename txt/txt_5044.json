This post is another poor attempt to win votes for Cruz. If Killery or Bernie win the Second Amendment is in trouble as will be the first.

They don't know a Good Thing When They See It!","commenter_a":"For the life of me , I cannot understand the obsession all these small minded liberals have with the Trump family. Is it jealously ?? You can't possibly spend that much time dwelling on people you don't even know. Lots of people weren't happy with the Obama presidency or his crude wife, but they didn't spend every waking moment stalking them, writing fake news about them. At this point I have serious concerns that there is a mental health epidemic in this country as far too many people are consumed with hatred that has no true origin. Hopefully the pharmaceutical companies can keep up with the demand for medications that clearly need to be prescribed.","post_message":"Maybe now this reporter will think twice before attacking the first lady."},{"comment_id":"863341973762056","commenter_b":"It's not s scheduled White House speech.
