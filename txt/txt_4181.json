Allowed Americans to be slaughtered when they could have been saved, then lied to the victims families and the American people about it. 3. Rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 4. Selling military equipment and other favors for donations to the Clinton Foundation. 5. Threatening victims of her husbands sexual indiscretions. 6. Risked national security by sending classified information over an unsecured server. 7. Has lost her license to practice law due to dishonesty.

Quran (9:73) - \"O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.\" Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter. It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith.","post_message":"We as a company have aired or released many horrible images in our short tenure as a media outlet, none of which have risen to the level of depravity of the images of Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbehâ€™s death. We had chosen not to release these images out of respect for the victim, his family and his countrymen, but also because we do not wish to spread fear and the message of psychopathic killers. This morning, I, as the owner and operator of TheBlaze, have changed my mind. After looking at the images again, I believe it is important for the world to see them. We have been lured into a poppy field where we have fallen fast asleep as grave danger quickly approaches. It is time to wake up. This is the enemy of all mankind.

Conservatives claiming the Pope is pro-gay, pro-abortion, anti-marriage, blah,blah. The Pope has never said he agrees with those things, he has said it's not his place to judge others who have that life style. Just like Jesus would do today. He loves everyone without reservation. Something sorely lacking in today's society.","post_message":"Pope Francis says addressing climate change `can no longer be left to a future generation'"}]
