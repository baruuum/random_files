Im a Trump supporter. I think these stupid battles between the two are immature and I think making this some huge talking point in the world is exactly why all of us keep electing the wrong people. We care more about a piece of food on someones face then what theyre actually saying.

But since he will hopefully go to prison, its a shame someone never showed him an illustration on a blackboard about the size of your asshole before prison and the size it is when/if you get out.
