Whatever a girl says is not important. Men do not want to hear what a girl has to say. Little boys have a voice but little girls do not. The husband's voice is more important than his wife's. Seriously? I can't even imagine what kind of \"joke\" they were trying to tell with this photo. This is hardly funny at all. It's not that this is necessarily offensive, it's just frickin' sad, ignorant, and misogynistic.
