They want to raise the gas tax, they want to introduce a milage tax. Who will this hurt the most? The pood and middle class. The Democrats don't care about the poor and middle class, they view them as cannon fodder. And uninformed people keep voting for them.","post_message":"The Obama administration and this Dem like the idea of using taxpayer dollars to study... new ways to tax people.

I don't excuse all of the bad things the crooks who call themselves \"my government\" do. And none of that excuses crimes Israel commits. Including the subversion of my country's government via AIPAC and all of its spies, such as the traitor Jonothan Pollard, and dual-citizen Israeli loyalists in positions of influence and power. If you don't like the crimes my country has commited in the Middle East since 9/11, you can attribute a big part of the blame on Israel and its subversives in the US. Not all, but a big part.","commenter_a":"The excuse is always the same. A missile from Gaza lands harmlessly into the Israeli desert. Israel bombs the hell out of Gaza, killing dozens or hundreds of civilians. When are people going to wake up to this scam. Israeli agents shoot off the missile to provide a pretext for Israel's aggression.","post_message":"URGENT"}]
