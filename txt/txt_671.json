Our taxes would have to go way up to cover that. I don't think Don can cover that out of his own pocket.","commenter_a":"I am an American. My children are American. My Grandparents and Great Grandparents were immigrants to this country. They came from Poland, Germany and Italy. I am a woman. I am successful in the male dominated auto industry. Donald Trump has spoken against every good thing I have been taught to be proud of in America. He is a ignorant, lying buffoon. #imwithher","post_message":"Yesterday, Donald J. Trump said that the judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University should be disqualified from his job because, in Trump's words, he has “Mexican heritage.”   Judge Curiel was born in Indiana—and last I checked, that's in the United States of America. Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. He’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.   Let's be clear about what Trump is saying. He thinks that because Judge Curiel's family has Mexican roots, he can’t do his job. Donald Trump isn't just wrong about this; his words show that he’s wrong about America. He’s wrong about what makes this country great. And on a day that we are mourning Muhammad Ali, let's remember that we live in a country where people can break down barriers, worship their own god, choose their own name, and lead and follow their dreams as far as their hard work and talent will take them. I’ve always believed that in America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is—we should be judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, heritage, or religion. Well, it's time to judge Donald Trump by his words and deeds. And I believe that his prejudiced, bigoted words and deeds disqualify him from being President of the United States."},{"comment_id":"1782129738697799","commenter_b":"She doesnt know, she just wants to bash him because shes a Kate fan.","commenter_a":"Shameful that these girls have been brainwashed.....the mother is more responsible for the marriage breakup. She treated the father horribly. TLC destroyed this family. Just as you have one mother young ladies; you also have one father. He nurtured you as well when you were babies up to the point your mother ran him off. Look at your old pictures and first episodes of your show. Your father was pretty much left with nothing.","post_message":"“He doesn’t even know us”"},{"comment_id":"10152808147960927","commenter_b":"That is a disgrace and a dishonor to our nation's flag god help us people needs to open their eyes and stop being stupid!!!!!!!!!!!........","commenter_a":"Just filthy sexual habits","post_message":"MLK's niece warns on gay marriage: 'God will have the final word in this matter.'"},{"comment_id":"1279380305469095","commenter_b":"Obama said there are 53 states.

Wake up you ignorant fool!","commenter_a":"If you are a woman who is offended by what Donald Trump said a decade ago but you enjoyed 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and other movies and books like this than you are a hypocrite! Do you laugh when comedians talk like this or do you stand up and leave the room!?! I was not offended, I could care less what he said BS's with men in private - give me a break! I care about what he says and does now - I care about what he will do for our country! Look what Hillary did that mainstream media is covering up - her speeched released show she also refers to people as bucket of losers....has two different policies, one for public,one for private...not to mention the entire email scandal with her 'innocent' friends all getting immunity...why do innocent people needimmunity?","post_message":"After audio was released of Donald J.
