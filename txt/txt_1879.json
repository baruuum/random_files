If you walk up to the majority of Americans on the street they will not be able to identify that historical reference. You are stretching for a story here.","post_message":"The phrase galvanized a mass populist movement against U.S. entry into WWII. While it attracted a wide array of support, its highest profile spokesman, Charles Lindbergh, blamed American Jews for pushing the country into war.  Trump started using the slogan in the later months of his campaign, and despite requests from the Anti-Defamation League that he drop it, he stuck with it."},{"comment_id":"10156436861080354","commenter_b":"Barbara is either asleep or as dumb as a box of rocks!","commenter_a":"BABA STREISAND is a LIBTARD MORON, Like her EVIL BUDDY HUSSEIN OBUMMER...!!

Women should not be offended, but rather look at the monster joke. A man that has not completed his surgery is woman of the year. What a joke. Gentleman the majority of us would never want to be a man. We are happy with ourselves. I feel sorry for this mockery of a woman and an insult to men in general.","post_message":"Female Marine goes off on Bruce Jenner for winning 'Woman Of The Year' Award. She's right.

You said it before I finished my statement.","commenter_a":"It's very obvious what happened here, it has been right from the start. This plane was intentionally driven into the ground by one of the pilots on the plane. This was very clearly a suicide/mass murder. Sadly, this is not the first time a pilot on a major airline has done this either. We are going to need to start doing a FAR better job of digging deep into the backgrounds of the pilots that we entrust to fly our major airliners going forward now. Or, we are going to have to start piloting these planes remotely from the ground and only using on-board pilots as a back-up in case the remote piloting system fails for some reason.","post_message":"A bit of eerie evidence has turned up on the cockpit voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that crashed into the French Alps this week."},{"comment_id":"1059635564057454","commenter_b":"Yes, maybe if they progress a bit more they'll finally go back to saying the bible explains everything and we should pray poverty, hunger, and crime away.","commenter_a":"Progress","post_message":"I'm sorry, what?"},{"comment_id":"10153147899391636","commenter_b":"the womans a simpleton","commenter_a":"And MPs should be treated like....... ?","post_message":"What do you think of Kerry McCarthy's comments?"}]
