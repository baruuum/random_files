Also that according to court documents, that her ex was terrified of Amber after the 'assault' took place and that there was property that belonged to the ex that was damaged. Funny how records show one thing and now the ex is stating something different.","commenter_a":"Why isn't @username publishing the story Daily Mail and TMZ did about Amber Heard's domestic violence charge from her ex 'wife'. She obviously has a violent past and I'm not say that 'if' she was abused that what happened to her was justified. The fact maybe they had a volatile relationship. She could have also beat on him as well as he her, again abuse is abuse. But for all the victims out there, if she is lying for the money that's basically a slap to the face for those who were actually abused.","post_message":"iO Wright says Amber Heard suffered at the hands of Johnny Depp."},{"comment_id":"10153145036396167","commenter_b":"Maybe a big dick up there asses just makes them crazy!!
