Maybe after this the Japanese will come to Pearl Harbor and do the same. What is wrong with u people. The man is talking peace and yes what happened years ago was evil on both ends, it don't mean u can pay respects. I hope all presidents from around the world take a piece of what Obama has done to try and end hate because it seems like we are going backwards with trump being so popular. He's making it ok to be racist and hateful and it's not. Happy Friday y'all","post_message":"Pres.

Usually stories like this are about people fighting to keep someone alive who wants to die. This time, this poor guy wants to live and the hospital wants to take his life, while he is coherent and of sound mind? I didn't read the story, but I would bet this is all because of $$$ or medical insurance!","post_message":"Heartbreaking video shows Chris Dunn nodding and putting his hands together in prayer when asked if he wants to live."},{"comment_id":"1192807494093054","commenter_b":"@username Refugees are not illegal.

And my question is how can you hate war refugees, and many of them children, and still claim you're Christian. The tenet of the religion is to care for the stranger, the wretched, and the sick. Not sure what part of that is hard to understand. Jesus was a refugee, and so were his parents, we seem to forget that.
