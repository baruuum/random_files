I love the breed, had one 33 years ago, she was perfect and sweet and love able....don't think she knew she was a Pit. We got her at 6 weeks. She was the runt of the litter and blond. So cute, so smart.....we loved her. Her life cut short, hit by a cAr...our fault, out in country did not think there was enough traffic to leash her for her morning job, one car amd she ran in front of it....I have never forgiven myself. But she had my heart at day one. Good luck with your trainingüêæüêæ","post_message":"\"I don't want her bad behavior to speak for the breed -- rather, to behavioral issues born from neglectful and abusive homes.
