I'm an American. A REALISTIC AMERICAN!!!!! I agree with the person that mentioned the abuse of the welfare system, but those are Americans doing that. Illegal immigrants can't get benefits!!! To the person who said that the companies are putting money in their pockets I agree, but as soon as they have to pay minimum wage and provide benefits and go legit the cost will be passed onto the consumer it always does. To the person that mentioned Hispanic, Mexican etc. I never mentioned any group of people I made a general comment about all immigrants.

Would any of you go to the orange fields and go pick oranges for hours in over 98 plus degree weather for pennies a bag. HELL NO!!! But you like when you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for orange juice. If there were to be no illegal immigrants the costs of a lot of things people enjoy would sky rocket because the company would have to pay out more for employees passing the increase on to the consumer!!!!!!

In his budget requests for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, Obama proposed hikes in the appropriations for expenditures of former presidents, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service published Wednesday. The report, which discusses the pensions and other federal benefits offered to former commanders-in-chief by way of the Former Presidents Act, specifies that Obama’s 2017 budget proposes a nearly 18 percent hike in appropriations for expenditures of former presidents. He successfully requested an increase in such appropriations for fiscal year 2016. “The President’s FY2017 budget request seeks $3,865,000 in appropriations for expenditures for former Presidents, an increase of $588,000 (17.9%) from the FY2016 appropriation level.

Let's watch the Clinton Rule in effect: Colin Powell and Jeb Bush also used their personal email, but they are held to a different standard in the press.
