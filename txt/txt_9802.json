Well, it is already affected them in America, in Europe and elsewhere. The Muslim radicalism is taking over the World and nobody cares! Israel is the country that knows what is all about and suffers from constant terror and constant criticising from the stupid World leaders who sold their countries, the culture and civilisation of thousand years to savages.","commenter_a":"Key Positions in our government ! @webpagelink/ CANNOT TAKE THE CREDIT FOR THE BELOW. REPOSTING To President Obama: It was you who told an Islamic dinner - \"I am one of you.\" It was you who on ABC News referenced - \"My Muslim faith.\" It was you who gave $100 million in U.S. taxpayer funds to re-build foreign mosques. It was you who wrote that in the event of a conflict -\"I will stand with the Muslims.\" It was you who assured the Egyptian Foreign Minister that - \"I am a Muslim.\" It was you who bowed in submission before the Saudi King. It was you who sat for 20 years in a Liberation Theology Church condemning Christianity and professing Marxism. It was you who exempted Muslims from penalties under Obamacare that the rest of us have to pay. It was you who purposefully omitted - \"endowed by our Creator\" ...","post_message":"Ignorance isn't bliss if it's harming people..."},{"comment_id":"10154332643707686","commenter_b":"According to a new Congressional Research Service report entitled Executive Authority to Exclude Aliens, the last 5 presidents have used executive authority to limit or restrict the entry of immigrants and non-immigrants into the U.S. a total of 43 times. Ironically, it appears that President Barack Obama used this authority more frequently than any of his predecessors, exercising it a total of 19 times during his two terms in office. Here's the breakdown of how many times each of the past five presidents issued such orders: Ronald Reagan - Five times George H. W Bush - One time Bill Clinton - 12 times George W. Bush - Six times Barack Obama - 19 times","commenter_a":"Waters, Polosi, Shummer, Warren and a whole bunch of other libtards need to be slapped up side thier heads.","post_message":"Rep.

Yet why is it that while people...especially GOPers LOVE to scream bloody murder and point their fingers at those threatening to take away their guns and insist they not be persecuted the same way women who have abortions, gay men and women and birth control is seen as the devils idea. Guns kill people, The LGBT community hurts no one...all we want are equal rights and legal marriage, abortion in most cases saves unwanted children from being abused or just dumped in the trash and the GOP Congress has been trying to withhold food, shelter and a chance at a normal life from those born to poor unwed women. Where are those men and women when they see poor unnourished children who most likely are not wanted some being abused some being killed and some just starving to death.

And to those saying gun restrictions would not help because criminals would still get guns anyway: if you limit something at its source, if there are less guns being sold, period, statistically all criminals would have a much tougher time getting a gun. People with a history of physical violence and mental illness SHOULD NOT have access to guns, and today most can simply walk into a store and buy one as easily as anyone else - anyone who argues with these facts is part of the problem.","post_message":"What is standing in the way of meaningful gun reform?"},{"comment_id":"10154490901549062","commenter_b":"She has that privilege","commenter_a":"Well at least she looks happy.","post_message":"The Drug Enforcement Agency has confirmed that a woman arrested for allegedly selling drugs in College Station is the daughter of a DEA agent."},{"comment_id":"875288902530859","commenter_b":"I think she looks much better than that freak of nature.","commenter_a":"No no no no no!
