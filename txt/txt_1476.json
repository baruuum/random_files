Ivory poaching legally ended in 1989, but the demand will always be there and countries like China and Japan will always buy their way through these bans as long as we keep buying tacky souvenirs from Asia containing Ivory.

This is what we can do to reduce the demand of items made from threatened species.","post_message":"Poachers, beware.
