When calling this election \"not by the book\" is a gross understatement. Forcing recounts in some critical swing states in a situation where the electoral vote and popular vote are completely different is a reasonable endeavor. What's absurd is how much of the establishment is willing to lie back and let this thing happen, then assure us in the same breath nothing truly terrible will come out of this administration because the establishment will prevent it. Actions speak louder than words, and the inaction of pretty much everyone other than Stein, Sanders, and Warren speaks volumes.","commenter_a":"Jill Stein, election spoiler, is going to put that money raised in her own pocket to pay her expenses.","post_message":"This Just In â€“ Just a few hours til deadline..."},{"comment_id":"1457667300971814","commenter_b":"Or fire her!","commenter_a":"I am ashamed of NBC.

It takes the 1% to contribute the 99% of us that couldn't keep the economy a float without there financial support or contributions to the economy. What is ruining our economy is supporters like yourselves who probably believe in giving the minorities a place to stand in the bread line while they send there un-taxed & undocumented earnings home to there families living like royalty on the backs of the mighty American dollar. While the rest of registered documented citizens pay our taxes to make America great.
