If you watch a video of people getting assaulted and are ok with it then you don't have much of a moral character. Why should America allow illegal immigrants to keep coming in and why shouldn't we have the ones here deported? There are legal ways of coming to this country use that rout and people will respect you more. Don't want to become legal then don't come to the USA. Stay in the country you are from.","commenter_a":"Wow, this is pretty pathetic. Considering Trump's numbers I believe we can infer he'll continue to do just fine without Buzzfeed's advertising lol.

The article barely mentions the fact that this program is geared towards getting drug dealers off the streets. Cops make mistakes because they're human but this article gives two examples that make it sound like cops are robbing innocent people daily of their cash. @username strikes again.","post_message":"You may have never heard of this program, but it's a widespread practice in which police can take your cash without any criminal charges: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154203393907994","commenter_b":"Cut their dicks off.!!","commenter_a":"Wow","post_message":"THIS JUST IN: Police have released a picture of the second man wanted in the abduction and rape of a woman from a Walgreen's parking lot.
