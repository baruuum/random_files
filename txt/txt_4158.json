These were outlier polls. The AP is a 14 pt spread in favor of Hillary. If they don't make this look like a horse race the last week or so, people won't watch. Nate Silver pointed this out last night. Go check out 538 polls. Imagine 100s of weather models predicting a snow storm predominately tracking east and 1 or 2 suddenly say west. Those are outliers and not a reflection of the whole. People are in here all excited bc they don't know what they are looking at.","post_message":"JUST IN: Florida and Nevada move back to Donald J.

So many simple steps could be taken...background checks for instance or the banning of multiple-firing weapons ( one doesn't need a machine gun to kill Bambi! ) but the Republicans in Congress blocked even the discussion of background checks the last time it was brought up. With such intransigence in not even allowing discussion of the issue, I am afraid that no gun control law will be passed. President Obama is right to be furious as I am. As an American, I feel distressed, angry and frustrated but also, sadly, resigned. It is simply a matter of time until the next mass shooting. PS: Fewer than half of all Americans actually own a gun but those who do ...","post_message":"President Barack Obama is furious. Watch as he addresses the nation after another mass shooting.
