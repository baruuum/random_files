That's terrible. I am the wife Brett. I live in Texas, 10 generations next door to Mexico. Are there bad people there coming here? yes! Do we need immigration laws? yes! Will a wall stop it. No Brett. It wont matter how beautiful the wall is or how much it cost or who pays for it. Those drugs you smoke are going to make it here. Nothing you can do about it. The cartel will get immigrants and dope here. If anything there will be more killing and keeping that wall up is going to be draining on the economy. It's impossible.","commenter_a":"Trump's ability to showboat and boast out loud has a hypnotic impact on people who should know better. Please don't buy into Trumpmania.... he is all talk and I thought we were tired of that. You people have short memories. He was a full on liberal democrat just a few short years ago. Trump is telling you what you want to hear. He has no intentions of fulfilling these vocal obligations. It's all lip service and he will cater to his businesses before the people. Just because Bush isn't a loud mouth narcissist doesn't mean he can't get the job done. Trust me, you will never be so sick of anything as you will be of The Donald and his ego driven power play.","post_message":"“Donald I’ll take you on one-on-one in a debate, any time, any place,” Jeb Bush declared. “You name it and I’ll do it.”"},{"comment_id":"995007177263648","commenter_b":"@username if you are still pro refugees after this video, I don't know what to do with you....
