Muslims do not adapt to our culture, habits and language. There is one kind of human race which always cause problems: Muslims. The only thing Muslims do is fight. In your muslim countries, all what you guys do is fight, fight and fight. If you want to live according to the Islamic laws, go live in Muslim countries. There are enough Muslim countries where you can experience your believe . Let the people of Europe alone. Adjust or outside. Respect our Western culture.We do not need you. You are a cost for the European community. You make abuse of our social security. You have no added value for Europe.","commenter_a":"@username, All Muslims are terrorists. Muslim students have cheered in a Dutch school when they heard that the airport has been attacked in Brussels. Muslims have thrown stones at the police in Brussels at the time of the arrest of the terrorist Abdeslam.The situation in Europe is much worse than the media lets on. Muslims who commit such attacks are psychopaths. There is something seriously wrong in their heads. You can't negotiate With fools . There is only one way to deal with this. Eliminate! All the world has problems with the same human race: that are the Muslims. It is a fact and a reality. It is always with Muslims that the world has problems with. You forgot the attac in New York committed by Muslims coming from Brussels! Muslims are a threat to humanity. Please wake up Hillary. Face the reality of the danger!","post_message":"In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works. One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims. There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in this country. These Americans are a crucial line of defense against terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it’s too late, and the best positioned to block it. We need every American community invested in this fight, not fearful and sitting on the sidelines. So when Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals, and for racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods, it’s wrong, it’s counter-productive, and it’s dangerous."},{"comment_id":"10153792660631545","commenter_b":"Just like recent a white women in alexandria,la a manager at canes got stabbed by a black an but do they see us protesting and stuff.come on now","commenter_a":"Why do black people complain about their shootings???
