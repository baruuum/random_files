I've witnessed coyotes stalking my dogs while they're in the back yard, and I can't have barn cats because the coyotes kill them. The coyotes get closer and closer to my house every chance they get. I'm all for nature taking its course, but you can guarantee I'm going to protect my pets' lives over the life of a coyote. How do you know this coyote didn't just attack a farmers chickens or livestock? How are you so sure this guy executed this specific coyote for the sake of its fur? I don't think you are. Posting graphic videos for awareness is one thing, but posting a graphic video with the wrong facts is nothing but propaganda.","post_message":"WARNING: EXTREMELY HARD TO WATCH.

Do you \"vote your conscience\"? To what end? Don't mean to insult, but truly what do you do? Write in Cruz for President? IMO wasted vote..vote 3rd party? As neither Johnson or Stein don't have a snowball's chance in hell, they can't even get on the debate stage, wasted vote. Vote Hillary? Can't imagine that would be an option either. Any option that I have mentioned do one thing only..help Hillary Clinton. The results: 100k's refugees enter the country; amnesty for illegals who in turn get jobs, healthcare, not to mention open borders for additional immigrants to walk in through; the loading up of Federal courts and the Supreme Court with liberal judges who will destroy the very Constitution you and ...","commenter_a":"I have a better idea...Why don't YOU and the GOP along with Congress get on board with the true Liberty Loving Conservative Patriots?
