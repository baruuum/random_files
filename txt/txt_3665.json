And it's NOT whites against blacks but the other way around!!!! Freddie gray was a criminal as was Michael brown!! Both got what they deserved in my opinion! Both had rap sheets a mile thick! Don't break the law and you won't get arrested! Simple logic! Don't get me wrong in today's society many cops coming are only there for the power but there are more that truly want to make a difference and it's sad when they're charged for trying to remove scum from the streets!","post_message":"BREAKING UPDATE: Warrant issued for arrest of 6 officers in Freddie Gray case; various charges including murder, manslaughter, assault being leveled: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"1780142445541305","commenter_b":"Lmao","commenter_a":"What in the actual fuck","post_message":"Punching White Woman After Yelling Hate White People Not Hate Crime, Judge Rules"},{"comment_id":"1118917194866740","commenter_b":"Thanks for stating this. I'm a follower of Christ and so glad you get it about Tebow.","commenter_a":"I'm not a Tebow fan, or a Florida Gators fan, or religious. But I never understood the hate directed at what seems to me to be a decent human being that threw his actions has shown hes willing to help anyone.

They're thriving. Lol WTF. Way to make a point against yourself.

They want a unified black country within the country and that is completely ok. White people make up 70 percent of this country so by proxy their is going to be areas without minorites. That's completely ok too. What we need to admit is that as a main rule forced integration doesn't work. In areas which are more racially undiverse there are fewer racially based crimes. It doesnt mean we all can't be friends it means we aren't all the same culture. And that is fine!","commenter_a":"what's the points of hate we all go to die one day, so enjoy the trip we call LIFE","post_message":"Top 10 Most Segregated Cities in the US"}]
