She's the biggest racist we know, and we won't stand for it. Do you agree Oprah is racist?"},{"comment_id":"10152914112731680","commenter_b":"Many of us are of the opposing thought of this comment. The founding fathers had plenty to say for support of separation of church and state. If you are referring to the Declaration of Independence, the one time there is use of the word g-d, it is the document used for the separation from England, it is not our law or government structure. The Constitution is a secular document and no where within its body is the word G-d, bible, Jesus, etc used.","commenter_a":"Don't bank on it... Many Americans, republican & democrat, are really disturbed by the recent directions our government has dragged us... Anti-antisemitism, antichristianity, pro-Islam, pro-gay, pro-socialism, pro-communism, anti-gun, anti-speech two-way racism with one-way consequences... Many are fed up. There are NO good choices for candidates out there in either party so far.","post_message":"The 2016 map is favorable for Democrats, but margin for error is slim."},{"comment_id":"1050901851597824","commenter_b":"It wont be single payer with this Congress. Thank God the sane people control Congress. Liberalism is a mental disorder.","commenter_a":"Wrong. The ACA was intended to fail. This will be replaced by single-payer, all Medicare/Medicaid type system.","post_message":"Obamacare was supposed to fix the problems created in the healthcare system by pre-Obamacare government meddling. I wonder why it didn't work? Be warned - an Obamacare bailout (mostly for the insurance companies) could be on the way."},{"comment_id":"716079211915990","commenter_b":"Shirley you.
