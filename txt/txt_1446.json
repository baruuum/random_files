If history has taught us anything, it proves we must remain vigilant against such cowardly, terrorist attacks. America can lead, and we have the strength to do so, but currently lack the leadership. My hope is that our national leaders grasp why so many Americans, including myself, want the Border secured so that we not only deal with the issue of illegal immigration but we also ensure terrorists do not cross our border to do us harm.

But 'refugees', 'displaced people' and 'asylum seekers', all of which have clear definitions, are more useful and accurate terms than a catch-all label like 'migrants', and we should use them wherever possible.\" - David Marsh, Guardian style guide editor."}]
