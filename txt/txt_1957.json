Don't forget that ISIS are not 'real' muslims. And it is just a coincidence that 100% of those who join or support are muslims. This has NOTHING to do with islam. And it is only 8% of the entire population of Turkey who supports ISIS. (according to a recent Pew Research poll) But don't worry about it, they are not 'real' muslims either. Anyone who says that the world has a problem with islam is just a racist. We all know that islam is a religion of peace. Case closed.","post_message":"EXCLUSIVE"},{"comment_id":"496338953890018","commenter_b":"Dumb as hillbilly racist. This ain't your country.

He doesn't know policy, he doesn't think ahead, and he stumbles when it comes to content. Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz. I write such because the thought of Trump facing Hillary in debate makes me cringe. Kasich, the newest favorite of the GOP, cannot win. I love my home state, but Ohio doesn't save Kasich from toppling.","post_message":"Not budging."}]
