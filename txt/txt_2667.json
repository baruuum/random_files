Kinda bugged that I didn't come up with it myself!","commenter_a":"Ok, lets operate in the realm of hypothetical for a moment. Assume, if you will, the following: 1) There is a civilization capable of inter-solar system travel. 2) They would be bothered enough to interact with a species that cannot manage such travel. 3) We could hope to withstand attack if a species fulfilling [1] and [2] decides that we aren't worth keeping around. It seems to me that such a civilization, if it exists and meets those conditions, would be able to discern the effect of the gravitational field produced by our humble planet. To make it invisible in a visually perceptive sense is naive and utterly useless in the face of such circumstance.","post_message":"Should we be hiding?"},{"comment_id":"10153509704082452","commenter_b":"So she sees a medieval torture device in her snatch, boy that's a bright one right there.

Just think of how many tourists will flock to see this Great Wall of Mexico. Just like in China with their wall it could be worth millions of dollars every year to the Mexican economy. Also if he thinks that building this wall will stop people crossing the border into America every year from Mexico he's deluded what's he gonna do build it sky high to stop them coming in by air or build it around the coast to stop them coming in by sea and check every single shipping container coming into the country to make sure they aren't hiding inside or close off the border with Canada to make sure they haven't flown north first and are then coming in from the North. Get real people. This guy is deluded and the people who believe him are ...","commenter_a":"WTF !!!","post_message":"\"We will build a great wall along the southern border,\" Donald J. Trump told a crowd in Phoenix, Arizona, during his immigration speech.

Shut your mout bloody pig","commenter_a":"BBC News's journalist didn't have any story to write about Britain's own daughters? Those 1400 plus little girls who were repeatedly raped at the hands of Muslim grooming gangs for over a decade? Why couldn't she manage to that in her own filthy backyard which even produces terrorists who are raping and killing women in Syria & Iraq? Why did she feel that it was her duty to make a celebrity out of a rapist? Besides, the swines who are crying here for her are the same swines who objected to capital punishment for the rapist; who are now making money publishing stories of Nirbhaya. The pimps in Indian media who are talking about this are the same swines who objected to death penalty for the rapists. @webpagelink","post_message":"\"It was not rape, but my reaction was too involuntary, and its intensity too high, to say that nothing bad happened. Something happened. And it had the whiff of rape. I suspect many of you reading this will be eager to tell me what happened...\"  A challenging, deeply personal piece about why we need to talk about sexual assault in all its forms."},{"comment_id":"550509575137335","commenter_b":"So do it already arrest her corrupt ass because she is dangerous to our society.","commenter_a":"yeah...won't hold my breath !!

If you can afford the home-- mortgage it shouldn't matter what the value may rise or drop to. The libs set people up to fail by simply forcing lenders to lend.
