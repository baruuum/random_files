But rather that Melania was not able to speak \"authentically\" about how she feels about \"her\" own husband, Donald J. Trump. The fact that Melania had to use another woman's words to speak about her husband versus using her own words underscores something deeper--not just about the Trump campaign, but whether America can trust a man whom his wife does not even know.","post_message":"In-house writer with the Donald J.
