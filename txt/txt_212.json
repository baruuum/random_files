ILLEGAL entry to any country, including mexico, is against the LAW. Mexico has enforced their law and the US MUST TOO. That means a wall since mexican cartels have made another business out of smuggling people into the us and those who can't pay the cartels, find a different way. Mexico didn't like it when Guatemala did it to them and we don't like it here either.","commenter_a":"Mexico has the largest border wall on earth bordering Guatemala to the south in order to protect it from the violence and to protect its mexican culture. It shows the historically true nature of mexican politics since Maximilian was executed. Nothing in mexico is good for America at this time. We dont need there people drugs or crime.","post_message":"'Suicide bombings in Israel went from 1,000 a year to zero a year once they put that fence up.'
