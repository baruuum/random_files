What's even more troubling is that the media is in their back pockets, treating her like she just won the presidency, while slamming Mr. Trump! Sorry, but who was it again who had 33,000 emails wiped from her private server using BleachBit that can never, ever be recovered? Who was it again who had staffers destroy their Blackberry phones with hammers? Who was it again who blatantly lied to the FBI? Who was it again whose 'key witness' staffers were given amnesty from testifying? Who was it again who called tens of millions of Americans deplorables? And, of course, the list goes on and on and on!
