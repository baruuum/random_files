The founding fathers had plenty to say for support of separation of church and state. If you are referring to the Declaration of Independence, the one time there is use of the word g-d, it is the document used for the separation from England, it is not our law or government structure. The Constitution is a secular document and no where within its body is the word G-d, bible, Jesus, etc used.","commenter_a":"Don't bank on it... Many Americans, republican & democrat, are really disturbed by the recent directions our government has dragged us...
