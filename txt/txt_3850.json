Giseleangelique D, 47, of Thousand Oaks allegedly sought out young mothers under the guise of a charitable organization looking for women with 1 to 2-month-old infants to assist.  That's how D found Eliza Delacruz, police say. She allegedly stalked the infant's mother and then had a co-conspirator snatch the child. Three other people were also arrested in the alleged plot, which includes an attack on another mother and child in El Segundo.   What investigators say they can't figure out is why 3-week-old Eliza was killed.
