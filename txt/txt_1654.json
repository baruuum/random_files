Who is going to pay to train the temp, who is going to have to take on the extra duty of getting them up to speed, and who is going to pick up the slack while they get adjusted? Someone has to make up for that lost productivity. So the woman makes a decision to have a baby, and everyone around her pays for that decision. How is that fair? And not only that, but she expects to waltz back in a year later like nothing happened! She will most likely have to be retrained, creating yet another burden on top of kicking out the person who has done her job for the past year. Why should that temp have to step aside because queen mommy came back? Shouldn't that be HER job now? Why should she have to step aside ...","commenter_a":"How very 'pro-life' of them ;). It's no wonder some women need abortions, if you can lose your job or be forced to go on unpaid leave while pregnant, and there's no maternity leave after you have your child... having a child can seriously cause you financial distress to the point of ruin! States need to pick one or the other! You can't be pro-life if you're not going to support a woman who has a child at all.","post_message":"'I loved my job.

I love my country and I'll be damned if we're gonna stand by and let our government bring in a possible threat and believe me it's very possible with the insane actions our president is taking, this will turn out bad and it will be the American people who will suffer in the end","commenter_a":"' My parents came to this country 45 years ago searching for freedom and a chance.' But you dont want to afford that same chance to others? What a hypocrite.","post_message":"I cannot tell you what an honor it has been to run for President of the United States of America. My parents came to this country 45 years ago searching for freedom and a chance.  When I was born, we lived in student housing at LSU, and never in their wildest dreams did they think their son would have the opportunity to serve as Governor of Louisiana or to run for President.  They raised me to believe Americans can do anything, and they were right, we can. But this is not my time, so I am suspending my campaign for President.  Going forward, I believe we have to be the party of growth and we can never stop being the party that believes in opportunity. We cannot settle for The Left’s view of envy and division. We have to be the party that says everyone in this country - no matter the circumstances of their birth or who their parents are – can succeed in America.  One of the things I will do is go back to work at the think tank I started a few years ago - where I will be outlining a blueprint for making this the American century.  We must show the way forward on growing our economy and winning the war against terror, and especially defeating radical Islam.  I realize that our country is off on the wrong track right now. Everyone knows that, but don’t forget, this is still the greatest country in the history of the world – and every single one of us should start every day by thanking God that we are fortunate enough to be US citizens.  Now is the time for all those Americans who still believe in freedom and American exceptionalism to stand up and defend it.  The idea of America – the idea that my parents came here for almost a half a century ago - that idea is slipping away from us.  Freedom is under assault from both outside our borders and from within.  We must act now, we do not have a moment to spare."},{"comment_id":"1763955337222403","commenter_b":"Women over 65 don't have to wear them...lol","commenter_a":"If there was a young Muslim man in America...and Donald Trump was elected by popular vote to pass hateful laws against Muslims...How easy would it be to radicalize them against a nation that has rejected them?
