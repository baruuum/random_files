In one instance, Gabriel came to school with swollen eyes and a pockmarked face, she said. At first, he said he had fallen, but he then told her,  mom shot me in the face with a BB gun, she testified.  On two occasions, she testified, a fearful Gabriel asked,  you call that lady?, referring to the county social worker. But as months passed, and the boy remained with his mother, Garcia said she began to lose confidence in child protective services."}]
