America was first inhabited by the Indians. Christopher Columbus discovered this country by chance and we were not invited, so legally I would think not. We took over, slaughtered many Indians in the take over. So please don't go there. If immigrants come to America I agree we need to now come legally and apply for citizenship, but that is not the issue. The issue is the children born here! This is where they were born and with that they are American! Period!","commenter_a":"I'm not sure I agree with that statement because regardless of whether their parents are immigrants, they too have the ability to become Americans. The children who are born in this country are born on American soil and should be considered Americans, just my thoughts. After all we were all once immigrants and at one time even if we ourselves are not immigrants, we were born on American soil from an ancestry of immigrants and for that reason we too are Americans. I agree with many things about you Senator Vitter, but I have to say on this I don't agree.","post_message":"I think it's flat out wrong for children of illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens just because they were born here, especially when itâ€™s justified using a false technicality of the Constitution. I made this argument in a guest column in USA Today.
