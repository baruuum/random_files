Furthermore, I don't think women will ever understand how men think..ijs","commenter_a":"Y'all are so quick to judge. Giving him passes to cheat, doesn't necessarily mean he has cheated. And because she's allowing him to do it without being affected means that nothing is wrong with her self-esteem. If she just doesn't want to give her man something, then she leaves it up to him to decide where to get it. And who's to say he's making the decision to cheat? I highly doubt if she's allowing him to do it and not caring, then he isn't. That's so not how men work. And to say that they shouldn't have gotten married is stupid because they've been married for a while and I'm sure she has grown to bring about this decision with her husband. And you're not married for sex anyways.
