An effective wall and boarder security will prevent tons and tons of drugs from coming in, as a result people wont be able to buy as many drugs so the money they would normally be using to buy drugs will be spent on other things that will help the economy. So not only will it prevent drugs from coming in but it will prevent billions from going out to Mexico and that money instead will be cycled through the US economy and taxed every step in the cycle. This wall will also help clean up the drug abuse problem our society has and save many lives to overdose and drug related violence. Not to mention illegal immigrants not paying taxes but also sending their extra money back to Mexico. ...","commenter_a":"LOL..heck he doeesn't even know what he is talking about how can he keep up with himself...just hilarious to watch each day what has changed.

I saw my great grandmother suffer for other a year from emphysema that killed her very slowly. She started smoking at age 11 and didn't stop when she was 86 and still had O2 strapped to her face. Her lungs were almost solid black due to all the years of smoking. Its heartbreaking to have to watch your loved one suffocate in their own fluids all because of cigarettes... Seeing that I promised mysf I would never smoke, and I never have. Maybe I will get sick anyway, but at least I know I have the choice whether or not to expose myself to such a horrible toxin ridden thing.
