Elizabeth Warren of playing the “race card” when she attempted, on the Senate floor, to read a letter written by Coretta Scott King in order to make her case against Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. “It’s almost like a bait and switch, stir up the emotions, in the name of King—and my name is Alveda King—stir up people’s emotions, play the race card, which she was attempting to do,” King, who supported Donald Trump for president, said Wednesday on Fox Business Network. Sessions was confirmed Wednesday to be the next attorney general despite efforts by Democrats to derail the nomination. The full body voted along party lines to silence Warren for violating Senate rules after she attempted to read Coretta Scott King’s letter.","post_message":"Bitter, much?"},{"comment_id":"10155206212838984","commenter_b":"It could also be that the libertards Have No Taste!

You can't possibly spend that much time dwelling on people you don't even know. Lots of people weren't happy with the Obama presidency or his crude wife, but they didn't spend every waking moment stalking them, writing fake news about them. At this point I have serious concerns that there is a mental health epidemic in this country as far too many people are consumed with hatred that has no true origin. Hopefully the pharmaceutical companies can keep up with the demand for medications that clearly need to be prescribed.","post_message":"Maybe now this reporter will think twice before attacking the first lady."},{"comment_id":"1112383468868962","commenter_b":"So she's been here illegally since 1993........of course she'd vote for a criminal.","commenter_a":"If Facebook was not a thrown for liberals, and they removed news pages for being one sided, this would be the smoking gun","post_message":"She survived the holocaust — and years later, she’s getting her citizenship so she can vote for Hillary Clinton @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"864523933643860","commenter_b":"Judy.
