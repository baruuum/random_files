Do you live here I'm sure if we came over your home place we would be killed","commenter_a":"I agree. If America is so bad for these buttheads, get the heck out of our Country!!! Second, if any of these a-holes are getting assistance from our Federal Government (alias all of us), STOP THAT SUPPORT NOW AND FOREVER!!! The people who fought and died for that Flag to fly is the reason these a-holes can be protesting in the first place. I would put them on a plane like the other person said, but instead of flying to ISIS country, I would just drop them out over the middle of the Atlantic and see how well they swim. Hopefully they will swim in the other direction from our Country!","post_message":"The protesters in Cleveland thought they could get away with burning an American flag in the streets... but they never expected who was coming right for them.

They insisted on giving me everything \" on the house\" ! They were so kind and respectful to their customers. There was an outpouring of kindness from all who were in the store. The tip jar was full of large tips! They locked the doors right after I made my \"purchase\", but never once rushed me out of the door. This place is a class act!","post_message":"A computer outage is disrupting Starbucks sales in the U.S. and Canada, and its impacting a lot of people right here in Houston.
