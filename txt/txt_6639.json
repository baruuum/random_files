There are some extremely hard to admit, and in fact, frightening facts that I think we have all tried to glaze over for years. In Bernie Sanders we have got a candidate that is addressing those facts. Climate Change is real, most democrats are no longer climate change deniers, but I feel like the real threats are being overlooked. For example, droughts are happening all over the United States. We are quickly depleting our fresh water aquifers. When one factors Fracking into this, we are willfully allowing our government to destroy more of our fresh water systems. HRC cannot denounce Fracking. Now, before you think that article that spells out how much HRC is taking in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry is another Republican smear tactic, note that it is by Greenpeace.

The doctor at my clinic simply didnt show up for my first 3 appointments. All I needed was a consult, so they could refer me to an oncologist and behin treating the cancer. The first appointment was scheduled 1 month out, when the doctor didnt show, they had me see a nurse who confirmed I needed to be seen as soon as possible, and they scheduled me for 2 weeks later. Then, the same doctor didnt show for that appointment and it was another 2 week wait. Finally, on the 3rd no show I threw a fit and the clinic agreed to let me see a younger doctor who was actually in the clinic. And finally, after 2 months I got my referral to see the oncologist.
