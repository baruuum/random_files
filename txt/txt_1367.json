Yes, it's natural and better for your baby, but that's still a nipple being shown to the public...","commenter_a":"I don't think John was saying that children should be denied a family fun day. But, he is right, when the children are hot and fussy, they are no longer enjoying the event. They are miserable and they are making the person next to them miserable and you too. That's not fair to your child or the patron sitting next to you. I know parents want to see the rest of the game but, that's one of the sacrifices we make for our young children. Changing a soiled diaper in such close proximity is rude and plain nasty!","post_message":"The Cincinnati Reds are opening a nursing suite at their stadium for nursing moms who want to feed their little ones during the game.

A person who was there for most of their presidency and knows them better than just about anyone has listed a few corrections. Bill says: \"In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\" The facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal. Bill says: \"Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.\" The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the ...","post_message":"Hoy, el Departamento del Trabajo acaba de anunciar nuevas reglas laborales que garantizarán el pago de horas extras a trabajadores que ganan hasta $913 dólares a la semana o $47,476 al año.
