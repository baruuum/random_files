They say it's not a political stance but rather a business decision.

Are you guys blind. I only saw a pathetic man sniffing,drinking water, making faces. acting like the idiot he is. Never answered a question. Talked about himself. Never said what he would do as president. Next to him stood a confident women who answered questions, with plans for our country future.","post_message":"Would you like to see Hillary Clinton win big this November?"},{"comment_id":"10157640587160615","commenter_b":"#NeverHillary #BustTheDuopoly! She cares nothing for the populance as a whole and her smug haughty stance of needing a public and a private stance politically make me sick. Tack on her criminal past, and right wing agenda, and you bet your ass no progressive should consider voting for that pandering shill. Im done voting for a lesser evil, and will stay vigilant in ensuring a third party gets political funding, and grassroots activism because our system and the Dempublicans are controlled by a criminal elite and they are the enemy of Liberty, Justice and Freedom! #JillStein2016 #GreenNewDeal","commenter_a":"Down","post_message":"This Just In –"},{"comment_id":"10153146604638690","commenter_b":"the terrorist girl.","commenter_a":"There is no age for crimes, a criminal is a criminal.

Oh yeah and build that wall and shovel the illegal bastards out of the country. Ok Tommy-boy?","commenter_a":"No the majority of Americans do not want to keep the illegal bastards, but they do want immigration reform- it's called a wall! To hell with Sanders vote Trump!","post_message":"“We cannot and must not sweep up millions of men, women and children, many of whom have been here for years, and throw them out of this country,” Bernie Sanders said Monday. “As president, passing a legislative solution to our broken immigration system will be a top priority.

First time for everything, I guess","post_message":"The term 'manslamming' comes from one woman's claim that she walked around NYC without moving out of anyone's way and almost every man slammed into her but almost no women did.   So National Review's Katherine Timpf decided to try it out herself  and 66 women ran into her vs. just 23 men. You can see video of all the slams here:"}]
