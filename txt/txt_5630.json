DISGUSTING!!","post_message":"Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how significant an impact the opioid and heroin abuse epidemic is having on communities and families in Virginia. More Virginians now die from these overdoses than car accidents, and law enforcement currently lacks the tools to save more lives. Iâ€™m pleased the just passed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) will encourage co-prescribing of naloxone â€“ a life-saving drug â€“ alongside opioid prescriptions and also implements a measure to protect the elderly from medication abuse. I worked with a bipartisan group of colleagues to draft and introduce these provisions. Lastly, while I am pleased Congress was able to work in a bipartisan way to address this crisis, we should keep working to provide emergency funding that is critically needed for state substance abuse programs, law enforcement, treatment and other priorities authorized in this bill."},{"comment_id":"10154378235307061","commenter_b":"ironic since even king himself thought malcolm x was a hack","commenter_a":"I am a white man, but it seems to me that Islam provided to Afro-Americans a system of faith and structure that Christianity failed to do. These people took names of Islamic heroes, rather than the surnames of their owners. Muhammad Ali took stature when he changed his name from Cassius (Roman name) Clay (ancestor white owner?).
