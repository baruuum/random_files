Also I get discouraged when people call me names :(","commenter_a":"They didn't say \"get over it.\" They promised to look into it, did so, and concluded that their pop culture reference was fine and that people misconstruing it would be in the minority and no changes needed to be made. Kinda funny how you can spin a story with a contentious headline. Ben & Jerry's seemed concientuous and compassionate here, not combative and dismissive as the headline suggests.","post_message":"These folks became very upset over the name of Ben & Jerry's new ice cream flavor and demanded it be changed.

If they have minor children, the children should stay with their deported families, but be allowed the reenter the US after the age of 18 with the proper paperwork. Legal migrant workers are the backbone of many US industries which would not survive without that work force. We don't really need a wall we only need to change the orders that have been forced upon our border patrol officers which makes the ineffective in most interactions with illegal migrants.","commenter_a":"Does anyone know what it is that they are protesting? Do they have any suggestions on how to handle illegal immigration, and the vetting process of refugees and immigrates?
