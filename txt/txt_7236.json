To all these politicians it is PURLEY about personal gain and saying ANYTHING and doing ANYTHING for votes. I wonder why we can't fix our economy with millions and millions of illegals taking jobs and paying ZERO taxes. It's a travesty and a COMPLETE INJUSTICE to ACTUAL HARD WORKING AMERICANS!","commenter_a":"It's the dirty, lying, self-righteous, power hungry B Sers who allowed this Illegal Immigration to go on for political gains and votes. Migration laws continually are being broken by both parties to either gain or expand their political power. They could care less how it's affecting the American citizen tax payers, by costi g them Billions of dollars per year to feed them, send them to school, healthcare, and their babies born here become immediately American citizens. Trump in 2026 for POTUS, to eliminate this millstone around the neck of the tax payers.","post_message":"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe illegal immigration is a problem..."},{"comment_id":"1160841880602656","commenter_b":"Hello!

Our national anthem is fine the way it is, and does not need changing what so ever. The Honorable Member's health decline has nothing to do with this bill, and that headline is terrible to use.
