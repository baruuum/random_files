That's all that is necessary in my view. Instead they keep covering their ears and screaming \"taking away our guns won't change anything\". People wanting better gun control legislation don't necessarily want to take away normal/healthy/stable/non-criminals ability to purchase guns, we just don't want any psycho to be able to walk into any store and purchase a gun in 5 minutes.","post_message":"He says he's shocked that his son owned 14 firearms."},{"comment_id":"10154021624482464","commenter_b":"Adultery is one of the ten commandments thou shalt not commit adultery","commenter_a":"I vote biblically, for someone who stands for righteousness and one who cares about the things of God and not his own ambitions.

It's just ridiculous that men get penalized for acting this way and women can do the same thing and nothing happen. This nation is full of reverse racism and reverse sexism.
