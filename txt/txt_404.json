Pelosi would not even talk to the vets because she was speaking to a group of illegals.

That only people who subscribe to the stereotypical depiction of how black people dress and behave are \"real\" black people? If that's not racist against African Americans, I don't know what is... Smh. And isn't the point of ending racism getting AWAY from stereotyping based on the color of a person's skin? The funny thing is, the meme maker -who is presumably black based on what the meme says- is *trying to* say that white people are racist, when in reality - they have such deeply rooted issues of their own that they didn't even realize their meme was racist against themselves. Start with yourself...","commenter_a":"Looks like she for sent home for having a black date nothing's wrong with her dress","post_message":"TOO REVEALING?

Stop acting like Waist Training is associated with organ ruptures because it isn't. No woman has ever died from using a waist trainer in our society because we have made vast improvements in it's design. You can't be like \"WELL WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT YOUR BODY NATURALLY CONTORTS\" It contorts either way. The organ placement isn't even permanent when using a waist trainer it is almost the same exact process except rather than an expand you are placing the pressure in other areas making it look evenly distributed. The entire point is that nobody drinking, smoking or who is Obese (Yes we can tell when someone is obese) should be complaining and bitching at women who are using waist trainers periodically to go out, or to exercise about \"health\" without sounding like an absolute hypocrite. We ...","commenter_a":"So...insanely tight corsets are coming back into style?

But the personal attacks don't add anything to the argument. There's plenty of solid evidence to dispute among the things she says and has written. \"Old and sad,\" \"horse face\" and other things don't contribute to the discussion.
