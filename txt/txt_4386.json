This doesnt make me want to not eat hot dogs atall it actually makes me feel less wasteful about eating them. The thing about Veganism that gets me is the end game. What happens if vegans get their way, and the millions upon millions of domesticated dairy cows, chickens, pigs etc no longer have any reason to be farmed? We cant release them into the wild - too many diseases both ways. They wouldn't be farmed anymore - there wont be enough farmers if they cant make money.

You do know that cows and fish are animals and killed in order to make the food you find at McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Arby's, Subway, Taco Bell, Panda Express, Red Robin, Dennys, IHOP, etc. right?","commenter_a":"Don't do it!
