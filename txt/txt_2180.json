I flew everywhere, because I didn't want to stay at home alone, my guy is a commercial pilot and I can fly for free..so why not?Because my cbc count was low, I had to fly with a mask on, because I had to. I even flew on Alaska airlines from Denver to anchorage. I believe this to be an isolated incident...I was always treated with dignity and respect and allowed to go down first because I said I felt weak..Because I did! So tell me what's the difference between if an elderly person says they feel weak and a cancer patient says it?","commenter_a":"Dear America, your bottom line is not more important than common courtesy or basic human rights.","post_message":"\"We need to make sure that ... corporations aren't so concerned with liability and bottom line that they overlook common sense and common decency.\""},{"comment_id":"10154389152146955","commenter_b":"It's just what she does","commenter_a":"Its not like she left 4 people to die in Benghazi, Blamed a terrorist attack on youtube video, deleted 33,000 emails and Lied to congress,, accepted money from terrorist countries, or called millions of Americans Deplorable, this was just a small Lie about her health.
