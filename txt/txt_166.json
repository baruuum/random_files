We take this vile meme and destroy it with historical facts!"},{"comment_id":"966205513390919","commenter_b":"Ms Quintana what a selfish, entitled attitude you have. Who is going to pay to train the temp, who is going to have to take on the extra duty of getting them up to speed, and who is going to pick up the slack while they get adjusted? Someone has to make up for that lost productivity. So the woman makes a decision to have a baby, and everyone around her pays for that decision. How is that fair? And not only that, but she expects to waltz back in a year later like nothing happened! She will most likely have to be retrained, creating yet another burden on top of kicking out the person who has done her job for the past year. Why should that temp have to step aside because queen mommy came back? Shouldn't that be HER job now? Why should she have to step aside ...","commenter_a":"How very 'pro-life' of them ;). It's no wonder some women need abortions, if you can lose your job or be forced to go on unpaid leave while pregnant, and there's no maternity leave after you have your child... having a child can seriously cause you financial distress to the point of ruin! States need to pick one or the other! You can't be pro-life if you're not going to support a woman who has a child at all.","post_message":"'I loved my job.
