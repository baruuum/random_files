The child likely grows up in poverty, being told (by the same people that ended abortions) he/she is a leech on society (parents likely getting assistance), so that child will grow up and most likely do one of two things (a few will take a different path, of course). 1) begin a criminal career 2) join the military to be fodder Republicans want to abort YOUR children when they are adults....THAT is why they want to end the termination of unwanted pregnancies.","commenter_a":"Attack on women!!!!!
