The major reason was that 70% of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction under six years of the Obama administration. The WSJ Editorial Democrats vs. the Middle Class shows the devastating impact of Obama and Democratic Party progressive policies over the last five years on the middle and lower income class.
