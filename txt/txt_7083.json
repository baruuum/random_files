He did that in front of an audience... As a parent I get what he's trying to say... But as a woman it makes me angry .. The boys that are being raised need to be taught that when a girl is too drunk to give consent it can be considered rape - I say can because not every girl that has drunk sex is going to consider it rape - but some may - plus it's incredibly unrealistic to tell a college girl to stay away from a party with alcohol... U may as well send her to a convent ..","commenter_a":"This advice isn't blaming the victim. Advising someone to lock their doors at night is not preemptively blaming the home owner for a robbery. Should we live in a world where girls can go to drunken college parties and not worry about being sexually assaulted or raped? Absolutely. Is that the world we live in? No.","post_message":"John Kasich to student concerned about sexual violence: \"Donâ€™t go to parties where thereâ€™s a lot of alcohol.\""},{"comment_id":"10153688828342014","commenter_b":"Is this a female prison?","commenter_a":"Enact everyone who knows our job, calls us all corrupt, tells us we're poorly trained, and blames us for the inmate's behavior in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...","post_message":"ATTACKED: A PCSO officer is going to be OK after being violently attacked by two inmates STORY: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"504839586342663","commenter_b":"You slimy cocksucker","commenter_a":"The poor need to try harder","post_message":"\"We are the first generation in human history that can end extreme poverty.\""},{"comment_id":"10154803767550579","commenter_b":"Gary Johnson is scary and just as much a risk as any of them.","commenter_a":"Protect your Rights and Freedom, vote Libertarian Party, Gary Johnson and Bill Weld. ðŸ”” Give Freedom, Liberty and Justice a chance for a change! ðŸ”” Visit the FEELING THE JOHNSON Facebook page and give them a LIKE.
