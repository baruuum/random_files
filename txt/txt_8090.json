It's about getting control of a situation that's currently OUT of control. If we don't move forward with the current plan, than what? Yes folks we are not in the same situation, but a much worse one. SIMPLE! Think about it, they are already currently living here and paying NO taxes. Unless we can beam these people up bye my calculations, YEP, there still here. Let's look back at what was actually said, the President NEVER said he was going to legalize any body's current status, just give them a chance to apply while working on there current status. Is it such a bad idea to have these people come out of the dark?","post_message":"I've been telling people for I don't know how many years, you know it as well as I do that's what this is all about.  But no Democrat's ever admitted it."},{"comment_id":"10155352061210597","commenter_b":"While I'm not a fan of the president either, I'd like to point out that a terrible congress is not a reflection of the president. That is a reflection of voters failing to elect officials who actually do their job. Our government was originally structured in order to make congress the most powerful branch. Unfortunately, modern Americans think the president holds all of the power and are far too ignorant of what their congressmen are doing. Despite an approval rating below 40%, reelection rates within congress are still at 96%. That is your problem, not the president. Granted, Obama doesn't really help matters, but even as a republican I must concede that it isn't ALL his fault, and quite honestly regardless of the fact that he is a poor president there are no grounds for impeachment.","commenter_a":"Why don't you impeach this man. History is going to show this congress as the most inept and corrupt congress in history and is being complicit in the destruction of our country by inaction","post_message":"Mandatory voting? \"The president whose major policy achievement is mandatory health insurance thinks maybe voting should be mandatory, too.\" What do you think?"},{"comment_id":"10153649615904199","commenter_b":"The employee aint do nuthin wrong. she got hit. ole white girl lucky she didnt get stomped harder.","commenter_a":"The employee should be fired.
