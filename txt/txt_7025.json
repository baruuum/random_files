Theres just been several bills past so that its now need to know disclosed. And America has had the uk parliament put these same laws here. So that from a judge is a downright lie. Also almost every american these days became that way from imigrants. Infact at one point more than half of Scotlands population emigrated to the Usa. To try and scare monger over a handfull of idiots that went mental over the several million who are helping the united states in the military, your hospitals , your restaurants etc. Its just cringeworthy and shamefull.

You realise Germany is one of the most successful countries in the world right? In terms of GDP, growth, economic viability, social mobility, lower wealth inequality, higher math and literacy, better education, lower incarceration and homicide rates, lower obesity, drug and alcohol addiction etc etc. If being among the top few countries in the world for such things is \"ruined\", you clearly don't know the meaning of the word. Put aside the right wing and sensationalist news outlets for a moment, who's job it is to highlight every transgression of migrants and Muslims, in order to make things seem much worse than they actually are, and instead take a minute to appreciate just how successful and dominant Germany is right now. Merkel is smart, she knows migration is the key to economic growth and sustainability, even if it has some negative byproducts. ...","commenter_a":"Merkel has not only ruined Germany with her idiotic open door fantasies, she has caused havoc for the rest of Europe.
