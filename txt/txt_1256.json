He is more privileged than her.","commenter_a":"Are you kidding me? He is simply making a point that she is a privileged elite who lives by one standard of protection and expects the little people--the unworthy stupid masses--to try and survive under a different one. It's called irony. To deliberately misinterpret and inflame his message (as a call to 'assassination'???!!!) is just proving Hillary right--her sheeple are the stupid masses.
