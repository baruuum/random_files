How did the US government start this war? The Syrians and everyone else out in North Africa and the Middle East have access to the internet and make their own decisions. When people have access to information freely they act accordingly. People have free will to think and make decisions. No one forced the Syrians to fight or oust Assad. He cracked down on protests violently and this is the result.","commenter_a":"How can Assad sleep at night knowing he is responsible for the deaths of 300,000+ of his own people. It's disgusting","post_message":"What chance is there for peace in Syria? Join our Q&A"}]
