Can you just look at people and tell or what? It's ok for them to fight in the army but because they're \"illegal\", they shouldn't be able to live here. Illegal immigrants aren't the problem, racists are","commenter_a":"I'm a Mexican who lives in Mexico, I had to say that before someone comments that I should be deported. Let me tell you that WE, you and us, are not enemies, yet your federal government, and Trump have treated us like such. The point is that some of us even share family living in both sides. I do have lots of American friends who I care for and respect greatly. I do also know that the majority of Americans are decent, honest, hardworking, generous, and God loving people. I am not against you neither most of my fellow country men are. I ask you from the bottom of my heart and trying to appeal to your reason and kindness not to let all this crazy stuff mess with our relationship as fellow humans and as good neighbors. We are friends and family. Let's keep it like that. Thanks for ...","post_message":"We certainly have.

Trump has every intention of revising how everything happens in Washington, in terms of how it happens, how fast it happens, the routes you take to make things happen.

Lollll","commenter_a":"\"Psychologists tell us that 3 and 4 year olds often lie to get their way because they don’t have a moral understanding of the importance of telling the truth. 4 and 5 year olds often bully other children because bullying is a way of asserting their dominance and making themselves feel more secure in a world that is beginning to seem very scary. 5 and 6 year olds are often thin-skinned and vindictive toward peers who criticize or make fun of them because they are at a stage when they have exaggerated concerns about the opinions of others toward them. 6 and 7 year olds are often excessively narcissistic because they don’t understand their place in the world and haven’t yet developed the moral capacity for empathy. It follows that Donald Trump’s emotional age is somewhere between 3 and 7.
