I don't know why it's impossible to believe it will happen again.","post_message":"I will vote NO on the nominations of Scott Pruitt to be EPA Administrator and Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy.

We need an EPA Administrator and a Secretary of Energy who are prepared to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and their short term profits, and lead the fight to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energies.
