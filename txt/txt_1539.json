I beg you sir to chose it, its so much better than your aged and historical mind of past racisms and injustices. I look at your page and I see hate and division and lies, man and it saddens me. We're Americans and the media has us divided. I hate that. Its a new day bro, leave these young kids alone with your junk, let them grow up in a world without your racist wounds from the past.
