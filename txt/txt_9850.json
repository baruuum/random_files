A dad being able to use a changing table because those things are all to rare in the men's bathroom. Gender Neutral bathrooms make sense and honestly if you're so worried about your kids then go to the bathroom with them. Oh wait! Women can't go in men's bathrooms with their sons so their sons have to go alone or go into a women's bathroom just to piss.","commenter_a":"He wasn't even transgender.

And i was arrested and given a felony for child neglect... Judge here raised voice at me when i told her kids arent dumb. That mine is super smart. And sent me to jail/: now my ptsd is so bad i barely sleep since the day. Because im afraid he'll sneak out again.","commenter_a":"Was he pulled over for \"drunken milk driving\"? LOL! On the serious side, glad he was okay! My children were escape artists when they were younger. Have a toddler now and with having her older siblings around, she doesn't attempt anything like this. She's opened the front door before, but never left the apartment. We used alarms on the front door. Working third shift and having a toddler is hard LOL! But during the week she's at daycare so no worries there... Just worry on weekends when they're home with me.","post_message":"Deputies say the child was found driving down the road wearing only jogging pants and a diaper around 1:55 a.m. Sunday."},{"comment_id":"10154400564286509","commenter_b":"Delusional much?","commenter_a":"10 dead so far in republicans terrorist attack on Flint.
