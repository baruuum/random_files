The AR is light, easy to aim, and in a situation when multiple armed people are invading your home, it's the ideal tool of choice for protection. About 3 Million home invasions happen each year. How do you Anti-Gun sheep suggest people defend themselves from MULTIPLE ARMED criminals? A handgun with 5 or 6 round won't help much with 3 guys breaking into your house","commenter_a":"A killing machine? Some people really do think that if a person has a gun they are going to use it for killing people. That they are and the weapons are evil. Stupid and clueless","post_message":"It only took us 38 minutes to walk out of an Orlando gun shop with a killing machine. See for yourself."},{"comment_id":"919455181533446","commenter_b":"My kids go everywhere. I'm not getting a sitter for something like that.

There are plenty of legitimate issues that should convince anyone paying attention that Clinton does not belong in the White House. I feel like spinning 100 different (and in many cases overwhelmingly mean spirited) conspiracy theories makes the relevant confirmed issues on either side carry a lot less weight. I'm not saying that I don't think her health may be an issue, or even that it shouldn't even be written about, but there are 100 different reasons for a vehicle like that to include a wheelchair lift.","commenter_a":"Is anyone else tired of these feeding frenzies, I for one am.","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"1384042331652908","commenter_b":"Good on ya.","commenter_a":"I stopped looking twenty years ago and saw my best friend and \"soul mate\" even though I know that souls are just a fantasy, right in the mirror. So me and my self became best friends and I haven't needed anyone in my life since then. I've been happier, I bought two homes in the last twenty years, and the freedom from the male drama is the best feeling in the world!!!","post_message":"As one writer points out, we spend endless hours wishing for, praying for, begging for our soul mates – that person who will finally make all the suffering worth it. But I’m here to tell you a little secret."}]
