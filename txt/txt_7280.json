Much more than a lump of cells. At 18-22 week the child can be born and live a normal life 9 time s out of 10 even if the mother's life is in danger at this point there is no more dangers to birth over abortion. On top of that... healthy infants get adopted by people that want them...","commenter_a":"This has nothing whatsoever to do with humane treatment. It's another attempt at shaming the woman for making her own personal choice and finding a way to punish her. This is also another ill-fated attempt at giving a fetus, a few cells, personhood. A fetus nor a clump of cells can be made to be treated as a once living, breathing human being, nor should it be treated as such. As soon as these \"lawmakers\" can dictate that, it's a short road to personhood, to claiming murder and denying a woman a choice and having autonomy over her own body.","post_message":"About 35,000 public comments poured into the Texas Health and Human Services Commission about the rule change."},{"comment_id":"10152897950463445","commenter_b":"To steal God is an oxymoron! Obviously your ignorant! God is there for everyone. It says in scripture that God will call up people from every nation on earth. After the rapture and 1000 yrs of destruction The promise land will be restored in all it's glory. And it's ridiculous to say everyone is Muslim, there were religions that worshipped idols and had orgies as part of their religious beliefs. This is what angered God and he wiped out the wicked in the great flood.","commenter_a":"My God doesn't reward murder , or threaten that if a person doesn't repent according to the Koran they will be killed. My God wouldn't reward living a just and Godly life with going to heaven and having 72 virgins!!! God would never give a sexual gift as a reward. Muslims treat women like shit, just like a woman has no civil rights. In America we have the right to practice whatever religion we want and freedom of speech.

The #1 cause of abortion is unplanned pregnancy. Universal coverage for birth control has done a great job of reducing abortions in other countries. Equal pay guarantees also work - mothers in this country experience a greater wage gap than childless women. Job protection is an issue here. Women in this country still experience job loss solely because of pregnancy. And, child support is a huge problem here. Civilized countries pay custodial parents child support, and THEN collect it from the non-custodial parent. Knowing that you can afford to feed, house, and clothe a child is a factor when deciding whether to continue a pregnancy.","commenter_a":"If these conservatives really wanted to prevent abortions -- they should be handing out birth control like it was candy. After all, if you prevent an unwanted pregnancy you automatically prevent the need for an abortion. But I guess that kind of logic is beyond the comprehension of most conservatives. Considering the conservatives are trying to restrict or elimiminate access to birth control as well -- I don't think this is about preventing abortions at all. It seems like it's about a group of morally uptight religious busybodies going around poking their noses into other people's private matters and wanting to have total control over those people's lives.","post_message":"Trevor encourages abortion opponents to extend their pro-life stance beyond fetuses."}]
