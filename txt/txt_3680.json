You're telling them that it's okay to lie, cheat, and steal, so long as it breaks the glass ceiling. You're telling them that it's okay to stand behind an unrepentant philanderer so long as it is politically expeditious. You're telling them that one does not need to take a principled stance on any issue in order to be successful; one only needs to adhere to populist notions. The only way in which last night was historic is in the sense that this marks the first time in American history that a candidate won the nomination under FBI scrutiny. This is also the first time in which an entire political party was caught actively sabotaging a candidate. ...","post_message":"Democratic Party nominates Hillary Clinton.

It gave us GEORGE BUSH. Remember Florida? Bush-2,912,790; Gore-2,912,253; Nader-97,488; Buchanan/Foster-17,484. Do the math. Please tell me, what good did that do? Are we way ahead of where we were 16 years ago? You know what Bush did. He appointed John Roberts and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, gave us Iraq, Isisl and the Middle East, tax breaks for millionaires, FEMA during Katrina, the Great recession and the road to Trump. Read what \"Art of the Deal\" writer Tony Schwartz has to say about Trump and realize that it's better to have Hillary in charge while you use your outrage to build a party around progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley. The unfortunate truth is, if you don't vote for Clinton/Kaine this year, we'll have Trump/Pence next year. ...","post_message":"\"Let’s go make history and elect Hillary Clinton the 45th president of the United States!\" —Tim Kaine"}]
