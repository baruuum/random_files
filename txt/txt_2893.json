Let's talk again when there's only days left of this nonsense.","commenter_a":"Jim Webb won this debate: he got more exposure out of the media tonight than he has had since he began his candidacy. Compared to Clinton he looks honorable, compared to Sanders he looks responsible. Since those two are the media darlings, those are the only two he needs to be compared to until he can get out of single digit polls.
