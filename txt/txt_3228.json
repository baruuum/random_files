The people that make it possible for illegals to get driver's license are the same people who refuse to correct the laws that allow career criminals to run the streets killing cops and our children.","commenter_a":"How about we stop issuing drivers licenses to people that have broken the law and are here illegally? Blaming the current governor for this is absolute stupidity. Blame Richardson and the democrats in Santa Fe, this is all on them!","post_message":"The most logical way to comply with the REAL ID law is for the Governor to agree to a bipartisan plan for a two-tier driverâ€™s license in New Mexico. Republicans and Democrats in the state Senate crafted a compromise last session that would have resolved this issue. The Governor should agree to that compromise. This will address concerns about public safety, meet the requirements of the REAL ID law, and assure that New Mexicans can continue to access federal facilities and airports. @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10155180907040649","commenter_b":"@username You are right but the other way around Soros running Obama and Hillary.
