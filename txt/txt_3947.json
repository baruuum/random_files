John McCain with Sarah Palin couldn't do it 8 years ago, Romney choked 4 years ago when he didn't even mention the Benghazi attack and coverup when it happened less then 2 months before the election 4 years ago. So, Trump took matters into his own hands and won the Presidency - practically all by himself when he was against all odds, while also helping to secure The House and The Senate...!!! The Republicans have no excuse now...!!! But one thing is for sure, the Republicans and the Democrats sure better know who the BOSS is now..! It's time to get down to business for America..!","post_message":"So now we have the House, and now we have the Senate, and now we have the White House -- and now we have no excuses.
