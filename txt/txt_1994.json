When was the last time she looked in a mirror ...","post_message":"Another thing noticed in the Wikileaks release of the full transcripts Hillary Clinton’s paid appearances for Goldman Sachs: she described Republicans as “backward-looking” and fundamentally un-American.”  So in addition to being rednecks (according to Bill), people who don’t support her politically are racists, sexists, homophobes, xenophobes and Islamophobes; a “basket of deplorables” who are backward, irredeemable and fundamentally un-American.    So I have to wonder: why does she want to be the leader of all us horrible people?  If she hates everyone who disagrees with her that much, instead of running for President, why doesn’t she just run for mayor of Berkeley?"},{"comment_id":"10152774860755927","commenter_b":"Is this wife beater and Obama DNA guzzler still relevant?","commenter_a":"The question is does Reid understand the U.S. Constitution?
