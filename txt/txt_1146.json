He deserves jail time and exciled (spelled wrong sorry) from our country. People should not buy his music if possible it should be banned. Exciled him now not later. God bless the USA!!!!!!!!!","post_message":"This is absolutely traitorous. He should be in jail for this.  We're tired of seeing the flag disrespected. Let's start a movement to bring the American flag back...!  Can we get 50,000 'LIKES' for the American flag?"},{"comment_id":"10155118024265231","commenter_b":"No","commenter_a":"It depends on the relationship the bride has with the mother of her fiance's child. If they get along great! If she is simple and has secret feelings for him then no. There are so many different scenarios. What works for one group may not work for others. And it may not have to do with maturity.","post_message":"Your fiance's 'baby mama' wants to attend your wedding. Do you let her? #AskDemetria"},{"comment_id":"1152891968103883","commenter_b":"She is very cute and beautiful little baby but don't present her like,' world's most beautiful girl'. You are ruining her childhood, i guess it's already been ruined but better late than never. Let her live her normal life please. I could see her turn into justin bieber like child in the future. He was no doubt blessed child but what media attention has done to him?? Spoliled him forever. One thing more how can you claim WORLD'S most beautiful child?

All my friends would describe themselves as feminists (male and female). None of them support Trump. Funny that.","commenter_a":"The insult 'a basket of deplorables', is the best exhibit of Hillary Clinton discriminating personality. There is a big number of registered democrats (like myself) for Donald J. Trump. So all democrats and independents (forget the republicans) supporting Trump, are that? That is how cheat this woman is. If elected, she will do the same to any ethnic group rejecting her, and will blow up one country after another, starting with Russia. Deplorable, is Hillary Clinton for expressing herself that way about the 75% of US citizens. (Ivan Mintz/Eric Trump)","post_message":"Republicans slammed Hillary Clinton for saying that half of Donald J. Trump’s supporters fit into a “basket of deplorables.'"}]
