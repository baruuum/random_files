Women don't hate each other naturally any more than men do. That's nurtured behavior. If we support each other more, things will change. This goes on all fronts. I can't tell you how many housewives hate me just b/c I'm not a submissive woman who pushes out kids and reads mommy porn (those ideas are also ingrained on far too many women-in the year 2015...)","commenter_a":"I've definitely seen it and it's so ingrained that a lot of people don't notice.","post_message":"When a man talks in a meeting, he gets heard, but when a woman does, she gets interrupted, Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant write.

If a diamond ring is a deal breaker for a woman she needs a reality check","commenter_a":"Thank fuck I have a husband who knew when he was proposing to me that I'm not a shallow twit who will only accept diamonds :) Also to those who say you don't get the sparkle with a fake, let me tell you, you do, you get sparkle in abundance, just because its \"fake\" doesn't mean its not good quality!!
