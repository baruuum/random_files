No more anchor babies. No dream act, no in state tuition, nothing. The illegals are a slap in the face to the people who are legally trying to immigrate.","commenter_a":"Good Paul!","post_message":"Just minutes ago, on Fox News' On the Record, I announced I will introduce legislation this week to cut off ALL federal taxpayer funding for so-called 'sanctuary cities' -- until they start abiding by federal law.  For taking this stand, I know I'm going to be attacked like never before.  But I think it's high time someone did something!  The truth is, for years politicians in BOTH parties have promised you and me secure borders.  But all we have to show for those promises is sheer lawlessness.  This President has time and again sought to go around Congress with illegal and unconstitutional executive actions regarding immigration.  And now many American cities are following in lockstep in open defiance of federal law!  These so-called 'sanctuary cities' prohibit the use of funds to enforce federal immigration law, usually banning officers from even asking about a person's immigration status.  These cities become magnets for illegal immigrant criminals and gang members who have been deported multiple times, but know they're safe if they can just stay within a city's borders.  This can't be allowed to stand.  Not when we know terrorist organizations are looking at our porous southern border as a way to gain entry into the United States.  Not if we are to save the concept of rule by law.  My bill would end all federal taxpayer funding for these cities until they start ENFORCING federal immigration law.  I know these cities will shriek and moan that there shouldn't be any strings attached to all of your tax dollars.   They'll say they're entitled to pick and choose what laws they recognize.  And you can bet our national media will be on their side, and come after me with everything they have.  But it's time politicians cared more about keeping their promises to the American people than what our national media says.  If you agree, I need to hear from you right away.
