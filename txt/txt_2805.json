They aren't exactly sure what they won since their candidate keeps back peddling on his entire platform. They'll just know that they won. We all lost.

Breasts arent genitals and they are legal in ny. Also its 2015, so if they ban toplessness in nyc or just the times square section, men jogging around topless or wearing loose tanktops showing nipples should be banned as well. Its the same body part. As a matter of fact men in beach should wear something to cover their bare chests as well. Its only fair to women.","commenter_a":"Nope! First Amendment vs. Decency!

There is an enormous amount of drug trafficking, Sex trafficking and a lot of bad people are coming through our borders. Yes their are a lot of great Latinos in this country and my husband is one of them but what basically everybody is saying is that Donald Trump is a horrible person and a racist simply because he wants to stop illegal immigration in this country. let's not get started on what people are saying about Donald Trump supporters. That we're ignorant that we are racist. And please don't lecture me on how I should respond to things! Like I'm some child in a classroom and you're the teacher. You're being extremely condescending.","commenter_a":"This is total bullshit!!Mexicans that think we are racist because we want to have a wall how about the wall you have between Guatemala and the Mexico border. None of you ever answer that question. (and if you want to get technical it's not a wall it's a huge fence with Barbwire on top of it)And I'm not a racist my husband is Latino and my children are considered biracial so stick it where the sun don't shine,I don't want to hear any of that crap.The people in this country are totally fine with legal immigration it is illegal immigration that Americans have a problem with. I don't see Mexico having open borders and even if they did they certainly wouldn't be giving illegal immigrants welfare food stamps Medicaid I could go on and on and it's all being paid for by the hard-working American taxpayers.it sucks when you live ...","post_message":"The Latino community has a powerful message for Donald Trump.  #MicBrights"}]
