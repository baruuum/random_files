God bless Isreal.","post_message":"Inside Story: Israeli government leaders have repeatedly said they don't want changes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.  Israel is also accused of funding groups advocating major changes to who can pray at the sacred and sensitive site in Jerusalem.  What are the implications of Israel action? And with growing discontent in the occupied Palestinian territories, is it a recipe for more unrest? @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"10154635792157599","commenter_b":"The GOP is better than this. The USA is far better than this. Be bold, represent your district, and stand against the unconstitutional, corrupt administration that has taken office. The administration's actions should be leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work closely together and assert power as the legislative branch, rather than acting as an extension of the executive branch. #NoBanNoWall","commenter_a":"Congressman Reichert, I believe it is important to remember that the United States of America is a REPRESENTATIVE republic. As our elected REPRESENTATIVE, please REPRESENT the people of your District. You were elected to REPRESENT the people of the 8th Congressional District of the State of Washington (NOT Donald Trump).","post_message":"Careful vetting to ensure the safety of the American people is the responsibility of the federal government and one I take very seriously. Unfortunately what we saw this past weekend was mass confusion and miscommunication between government agencies and the improper apprehension of people legally allowed to be in the US. I urge the administration to work with Congress on solutions that protect our borders while maintaining our nation's dedication to compassion and religious freedom."}]
