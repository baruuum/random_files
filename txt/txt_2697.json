You and the Cash Me Ousside chick should go hang out and play in traffic.","commenter_a":"Who puts a three month old into daycare??? Mom is so concerned etc. But that three month old needs his/her parents not daycare workers anyway. Plus no charges should be filed if daycare was not made aware of the lactose intolerance. Sounds like a lil neglect on both sides of this. Plus whoever took the video should have stopped this from even happening. This worker although breaking the rules was trying to help out a baby who is clearly already in duress when the parents should be the one taking care of them at such young age. I can almost bet that mother is more mad she had to take her kid to the hospital and missed out of her drinking time and watching tv time. Thats just my opinion!","post_message":"A North Carolina mom says a day care worker breastfed her 3-month-old son and made him sick."},{"comment_id":"1062574083799120","commenter_b":"Yay!
