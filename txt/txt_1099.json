How many? Palestine has a legal right of self-defense whether Israel likes it or not. Saying that Israel is a victim is like saying that Hitler acted in self defense. Israel has no more right to Palestine than the Nazis had over Austria, Hungary, Poland, etc... In 2000, 57 Arab and Islamic countries offered full diplomatic recognition of Israel if they returned to 1967 borders. Israel never acknowledged this offer. Israel kills in the name of self defense. US kills in the name of democracy. When they fight back they are called terrorists. When it is said to them: \"Make not mischief on the earth,\" they say: \"We are only peacemakers.\" [Quran 2:11] Isn't this the case today... in the name of Freedom and Democracy!
