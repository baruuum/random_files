If we must be told of the killing, we are told they are necessary to defend the way and . Because U.S. life is subsidized worldwide (and within the United States by people of color and poor White labor), racism must exist or else the entire edifice crumbles... . Race is not only necessary, but also a central tenet of westward expansion, for Western imperialism and capitalism are intimately tied to White superiority\" (Christopher Knaus \"More White Supremacy? The Lord of the Rings as Pro-American Imperialism\" Multicultural Perspectives, 7(4), 54-58. 2005).","commenter_a":"\"Who the United States considers to be evil is certainly not winning in reality. Poor, starving, bombed out women and children in Iraq and Afghanistan are not winning. The women working 16-hr workdays in sweat-shops in Thailand, the Philippines, Jamaica, and Mexico are not winning. The victims of human trafficking in New York, Florida, and Texas are not winning. Those with AIDS in Africa are not winning. The billions of poor people of color throughout the world are not winning. And yet we have set up an entire system of imperialized globalization, which we call democracy to keep them from winning. So we are, in fact, winning, although we only win because we have obscured not only what we are fighting for, but also whom we are fighting against\" (Knaus).","post_message":"Question of the Day: Which Republican presidential candidate do you think will be the toughest on radical Islamists?"},{"comment_id":"886419331393489","commenter_b":"Blacks have been raping, stealing and destroying everything they touch as long as they have existed and are still doing it today but t hey also never create anything.
