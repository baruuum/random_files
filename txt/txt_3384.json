Like in Sparta where they would kill the boys if they didn't have a warrior's body. Male disposability exists throughout the world including the West. And it persists regardless of the sex of the leader. The Queens of England ruled half the world for long periods of time but it was still the men who were disposable. I would never expect the mass media to address that.
