This applies to private sales between individuals as well as to sales by Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders.[7] For firearm sales by an FFL holder, or at a gun show, the seller must perform an automated dial-up check with the State Police, to verify that the FOID card is valid, and to redo the background check of the buyer.[4] This additional checking is known as the Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP).[8] For private sales not at a gun show, the seller must also verify the buyer's FOID card with the state police, and receive a transfer approval number, either via a web site or with a phone..
