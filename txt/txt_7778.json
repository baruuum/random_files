The women in most offices I've worked at wore sleeveless dresses and tops that were tasteful and appropriate. Even the women news anchors wear tasteful sleeveless outfits. I don't see a problem with that. I do however agree a dress code should be in place for kids in school.

One day when the liberals get their way and all the refugees and ILLEGALS are let in this country then maybe you may see what I'm talking about.
