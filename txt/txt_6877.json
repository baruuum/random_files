First of all you ASSume that every business owner in the country is a Republican, which is just more made up shyte by a LIb. Secondly, its called supply and demand. By flooding the labor market via illegal immigration and REWARDING illegal immigration, Libs increase the supply of labor in relation to the demand for labor, which lowers the price of labor.","commenter_a":"IT is amazing how those who vote republican seem to forget that Reagan and both Bush's gave amnasty to illegals, Reagan even went on to say that he would like to see an open border where the Mexicans could come and go any time they wanted, For all of you simpleminded republicans who want proof you have a computer look it up,","post_message":"Texas and other states suing over the moves say that only Congress can authorize the kind of sweeping actions Obama took."},{"comment_id":"10153127223956800","commenter_b":"Jodi, you are a serious bitch.

Because a lot of people are working on biomedical research. My wife and I couldn't get our kid into any kind of school or program that was adequate for him until he was 7 years old.

Jeb Bush, the heir apparent is a globalist and so is Hillary. So were the past 5 presidents. With both Jeb and Hillary running, it did not matter who won, the road to globalization was on tract. Enter Trump! Boy did he screw up their plans! No matter what they tried he did not go away! No globalization of America for him!
