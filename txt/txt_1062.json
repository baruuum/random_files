One had to back down and the other is going strong. Has nothing to do with mixing anything up. It's the consequences and the perverts backing this type of legislation. Are you going to day pedophilia is okay now?","commenter_a":"Has a \"sign\" ever stopped a pedophile before?? No. Classifying transgender and pedophiles in a group together is just so wrong. Boys are sexually abused at double the rate girls are so why is everyone not up in arms for their sons? And statistically pedophiles prey on children they know. Family members/close friends not random children in a public bathroom. What does it matter what parts the person in the next stall over does or doesn't have? There in there to pee just like you and go on with their life! Thats my two cents on the whole subject! But apparently many people feel so differently and even though I don't understand it I respect that not everyone agrees!! I do however feel so heartbroken for the entire transgender community whose repeatedly being compared to pedophiles.","post_message":"\"This means a man can simply say he 'feels like a woman today' and enter the women's restroom... even if young girls or women are already in there,\" stated the American Family Association, which started the petition."},{"comment_id":"1057253901026942","commenter_b":"and raising the min wage only cuts jobs, hrs, and closes busnesses","commenter_a":"We've seen this movie!
