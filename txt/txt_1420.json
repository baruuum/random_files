What Ted Cruz really wants to do like communist leaders would do in term of monitor arrest you and in prison you with any form of guilt. He want to doing like Castro. It's funny Ted Cruz father escaped Cuba to get away from communism. No Ted Cruz is advocating the same communist view his father escaped from. If you look at his policies Ted Cruz is nothing more than a communist pretending to be a Republican.","post_message":"Ted Cruz was blasted this week for saying Muslim neighborhoods should face extra patrolling to prevent extremism.
