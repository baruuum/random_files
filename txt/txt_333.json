John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Presidential campaign claims Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiding Donald Trump’s campaign because there is as AP reports  “a kind of bromance going on”.  As if one more fabrication of reality could sway the narrative back to the Democrat's camp. And whether the Russians hacked the DNC emails or if it was the Romanian hacker claiming responsibility known as Guccifer 2.0 really doesn’t matter.  What matters is that now the American people know how riddled with deception the DNC truly is. The political machinery propping up Hillary's campaign is quickly coming apart at the moment she should be dominating. The released 19,252 wiki leaks internal emails that were hacked from seven officials at the DNC have served as a battering ram, exposing a organization laden with deceptive practices on a monumental scale.  Aside from the DNC's obvious favorability of Clinton over Sanders because of her gender and the jabs taken at Sanders religion. The emails detail a manipulation of the media of grotesque proportions. Relegating mainstream media to nothing less than a propaganda machine.  In this email the DNC’s National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach says of a Politico reporter Ken Vogel “ Vogel gave me his story ahead of time/before it goes to his editors as long as I didn't share it. Let me know if you see anything that's missing and I'll push back.\""},{"comment_id":"559542634171067","commenter_b":"Attack Attack Attack !! We will give you something to cry about.
