In the 90s, the extreme right-wing Republikaner and the DVU gained in support because of this blind open-door policy. What is more, Germany expects other EU countries to do the same, irrespective of the cost. I say that this has to stop.","commenter_a":"The Germans typically let in loads of war refugees. More than they can handle. It's their way of apologising for World Wars 1 and 2. In the 90s, they let in 320,000 war refugees from Yugoslavia. What happened in German towns ? Property rents skyrocketed and the crime rates went right up. What's worse, the Germans expect every other country to do the same. Whacky open-door immigration. The UK needs to leave the EU, get sovereignty over its borders and immigration / refugee legisation back and tackle the problem as a single nation. This time, the Germans are letting in 800,000 war refugees from Syria. Absolutely crazy.","post_message":"Ever since Angela Merkel took the lead on the migrant crisis, critics began speaking as though she created it. This is nonsense"}]
