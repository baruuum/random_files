Knowingly and intentionally destroyed evidence in a criminal investigation. 2. Allowed Americans to be slaughtered when they could have been saved, then lied to the victims families and the American people about it. 3. Rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 4. Selling military equipment and other favors for donations to the Clinton Foundation. 5. Threatening victims of her husbands sexual indiscretions. 6. Risked national security by sending classified information over an unsecured server. 7. Has lost her license to practice law due to dishonesty.
