I like to use that famous Japanese quote in WWII as to why they didn't even consider invading the U.S. - \"Invade the U.S.? Impossible, there's a gun behind every blade of grass\". Our guns keep our nation safer and serve as, I hope, some ...","post_message":"Hillary Clinton: If you truly believe guns don't save lives, why do YOU have armed security protecting YOUR life with guns?

For all of you Christian Conservatives out there, REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS PARTICULARLY, we need to open our hearts and welcome the Syrian refugees in, otherwise we cannot call ourselves \"CHRISTian\". The refugees will be vetted over a 2-3 year period ~ they're not coming tomorrow. Be compassionate ~ that is what we are about here in the USA, remember our quote on the Statue of Liberty, which was a gift to us from France (!), welcoming immigrants and refugees: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to be free.\" How about we practice what we're preaching with this message?","commenter_a":"Tears.","post_message":"Watch this and you will get chills.
