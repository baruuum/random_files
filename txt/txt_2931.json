That was it for me. Iran has already violated the 5 year ban on developing and testing ballistic missiles which was part of the nuclear deal and guess what - do nothing Obama is just ignoring it. As far as national security goes - Obama is a disaster. And now he wants to bring in 10,000 refugees from ISIS territory who can not be vetted. Obama is not good for America or Israel.","commenter_a":"CORRECTION: It is under Obama that Israel has received more defense material than under any other previous administration!
