Right now there are 76k Islamic refugees that have arrived and continue to come. Barack Husein Obama has strategically placed them throughout the U.S. Now ask yourself, how long will it take before key cities fall to Islam within the U.S..? He knew what he was doing, and his plan is working due to tolerance and bleeding heart liberals. It may not be next year, however, in the near future, we will see more turmoil through Islam than anything else. Bullets and beans brother...","commenter_a":"Notice that the UN is NOT pushing to fight Muslim extremists so these people don't have to flee their homes?
