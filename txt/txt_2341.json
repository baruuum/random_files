Maybe the punchline is exactly what I wrote.","commenter_a":"What does this photo actually say? It says girls are annoying. Girls talk too much. Girls should be seen and not heard. Whatever a girl says is not important. Men do not want to hear what a girl has to say. Little boys have a voice but little girls do not. The husband's voice is more important than his wife's. Seriously? I can't even imagine what kind of \"joke\" they were trying to tell with this photo. This is hardly funny at all. It's not that this is necessarily offensive, it's just frickin' sad, ignorant, and misogynistic. Congratulations to this mother and father...they have essentially taught their daughters a very important lesson as to their place in this world...and that they have NO VOICE!","post_message":"A firestorm of controversy has erupted over a viral Christmas card depicting a man's wife and girls with mouths taped shut..."},{"comment_id":"10153696504537300","commenter_b":"Fidel Castro is a white elitist who took from everyone regardless of race.","commenter_a":"So this is written by someone who \"escaped\" from Cuba 46 years ago and found \"safe haven\"...please!

Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim. 2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump without being able to win at the negotiating table. 3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don need a policy expert or a legislator we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale. 4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. ...","post_message":"\"...for emotional suffering....\""},{"comment_id":"854169234726517","commenter_b":"How about rapist?","commenter_a":"If trump is despicable, what does that make Hillary ?","post_message":"\"Heâ€™s just despicable,\" Letterman said, adding that Donald J.
