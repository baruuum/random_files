She should have put her down for what huh, for what? Get some sense in your head !! The only guilty party is the lil bitch who hit the girl holding a child she is a straight up coward and thats probably the only reason she hit her cause her hands were full!","commenter_a":"I think all parties are guilty the ones egging it on the mother of the child and her friend. Her friend seen what was going on so she should have taken the baby and the mother... Should have put the baby down as she see the girl kept saying put the baby down and appeared not to give a dam. Believe me all parties played their part in the hatred or what ever that got them to this point. In reality the mother used her child as a pawn thinking it would have saved her from a ass whooping putting her child in danger. Thank God the female was caught and the baby is ok. They all need to get it together... Because believe they all full of shit and played a roll in this fight...","post_message":"Texas girl, 13, who was caught on camera as she launched brutal assault on rival teen holding a toddler is now in police custody"}]
