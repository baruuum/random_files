I will be voting for Senator Sanders instead because his willingness to look at everything and proposed changes would improve the lives of millions of Americans. Women and men.

Sure. But I don't. So....","commenter_a":"My dream is that Bernie Sanders agrees to run as Hillary Clinton's vice president on the condition that Elizabeth Warren be appointed Secretary of the Treasury and Bernie gets to focus on one main goal: voter turnout! Bernie can build the revolution he's been talking about by getting everyone more involved and then we can pick up some democratic seats this year and take back congress in 2018 with progressive candidates. Bernie's task would be non-partisan voter turnout and involvement supported by a strong democratic machine finding good candidates in local state governments and for congress. This is a long term plan, one that ultimately paves the way for President Warren. Bernie wouldn't get to be president but he would give us a good 16 year trajectory to push progressive policies. Wouldn't that be lovely?","post_message":"“In the last election, the mid-term election, 80 percent of young people didn’t vote,” Bernie Sanders said.“I’m very proud we’re bringing a whole lot of young people into the political process [and] that we’re revitalizing democracy.
