Trump won't subscribe to the site until they say he is great and then the site will be good. But it's very sad now.

Don't kid yourself Mitchell. The difference is that we would take up arms to protect the land by preventing poaching, over-grazing and unsustainable resource extraction, whereas these fucks want unregulated access to sensitive ecosystems.","commenter_a":"Oregon is an open carry state. These Militia men aren't doing anything wrong. The BLM outpost is on public property and was unlocked. There was no violent takeover.
