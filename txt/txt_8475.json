If you never handled pigs how can you say what is the best way to do it? if ya pick up a pig like a puppy it will struggle and squeal and put up a fight. but if ya hold it by a hind led it will settle down and let you handle it.

I am voting for Trump. I voted for him in the primary's and I will vote for him at the national level if he makes the ballot. I have been a registered Republican Since GW was voted in Office. Now I can agree that Mr Donald Trump can at times speak without discernment; however it is my opinion rather my belief that he is best suited for the position given the day and age we live in.
