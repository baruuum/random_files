There is no way you should be neck and neck with Bernie Sanders. But you're playing weak. Go on the attack. Use your willingness to stay in a marriage regardless of your husband's infidelity as a selling point. We all know people make mistakes. Marriages often dissolve over a hint of unfaithfulness and unforgiveness. Only the extremely strong can take a mistake made by a spouse to demonstrate their character. If I'm not mistaken this is Sanders' second wife and 'The Donald' has had three wives and several affairs. How many times have you been married? They can't use President Bill Clinton's infidelity to their advantage, but you can. Who are the people advising you?","post_message":"Jimmy Fallon: Can we do a Snapchat?

That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today.
