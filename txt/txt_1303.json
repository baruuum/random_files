I live in Seattle and the rate increase is just slowly beginning to take effect. No conclusions of this sort can be made.","commenter_a":"In Seattle where they just raised minimun wage to $15 a hour some restaurants are now going out of businss as restaurants are having to pass on to their customers a lot higher prices for the food they serve.","post_message":"An L.A.

Hey justice system you spineless useless system! It's because if your stupidity and loop holes that got that child a life sentence. Those children were given a death sentence by this useless pos. This vile inhumane waste if life still breathes because of your inept logic. If that were my child, I'd hunt that diseased vile pos down and set his black ass on fire...","post_message":"It was already bad enough that this man raped a 14-year-old and a baby. Then it got even worse."},{"comment_id":"10156744379040093","commenter_b":"'@username Have you SEEN Trump on the debate stage? He doesn't know policy, he doesn't think ahead, and he stumbles when it comes to content. Add to that the media penchant for tailoring questions to compliment the dem candidate, and <bam> Hillary looks like a freaking scholar on the stage. The thought makes me physically ill. On top of that, Trump has considerable damning words and actions the media and dems (but I repeat myself) will toss like confetti upon constituents. In multiple polls, Trump sits in the mid-30s, without waver. This is going to suck.","commenter_a":"Do the right thing and vote for Cruz. I write such because the thought of Trump facing Hillary in debate makes me cringe. Kasich, the newest favorite of the GOP, cannot win. I love my home state, but Ohio doesn't save Kasich from toppling.","post_message":"Not budging."},{"comment_id":"1141907219179950","commenter_b":"So, she won 3rd and 5th place.
