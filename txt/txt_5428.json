Trump's complete failure to understand basic foreign policy concepts, his relationship with Putin, and his out-of-control ego are a one-way trip into a third world war.

Officer Darryl Jouett removed his gun from its holster and was apparently trying to put it in his pocket when it went off. A bullet ricocheted off the elevator door and hit him in the stomach.
