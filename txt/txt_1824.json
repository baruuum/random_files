She admitted Planned Parenthood had no mammogram machine! All they do is feel the breast then refer you to an imaging center! Obamacare covers this. Obamacare covers birth control pills as well. Take your pill, no need for an abortion.","commenter_a":"Obamacare (paid by our Taxes) covers all women's health issues and problems - why is Planned Parenthood (which name indicates planning to become a parent) even needed.

Of course they are. Why is it perfectly ok in your eyes that we have to prove ourselves to exercise our right to bear arms, but having to have an id to vote is racist?
