Trump is correct illegal immigration is the most pressing problem for this country of whi h it is not in the least ludicrous. If you are much wanting illegals here then why don't all you democrats join together, invite them to live with you and pay their way instead of demanding we tax payers pay for all the freebies they get, not to mention all those ancor babies that we have to pay for to be born then pay for them and all the freebies they will be getting for the rest of their live.","commenter_a":"real change like we have never seen before.

Away and actually they checked on the children throughout the night. It is said the mother visits the place where the child went missing to walk the streets hoping to find her. The parents are devastated over the loss. Just because you or I would not leave our children like this doesn't mean we should be so critical or unkind. They made a terrible mistake ( in this case perhaps a deadly one). We should show kindness and pray for them. I mean after all what if it were you/me. No one is beyond making mistakes. They are tortured enough. Walk a mile in their shoes.","post_message":"Based on an examination of the bones, Australian police determined the child was killed \"some time since the start of 2007\" â€“ the same year Madeleine McCann disappeared."}]
