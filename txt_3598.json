Unless her mental illness was so severe, that she couldn't have had the slightest idea that driving into a crowd of people was a BAD thing to do, then I don't think her being an angry, evil nut job is enough to let this thing off the hook.","commenter_a":"Is anyone surprised that Adacia Chambers already has a days-old Facebook support group?

Paul LePage said his reaction whenever the debate begins anew is to head to a sporting goods store. “Every time there’s a big gun battle about one of these incidents, I go buy a gun,” LePage said to applause from the audience. “I have a big safe of them. I have five that I bought and I haven’t shot them.”"},{"comment_id":"10152999257859342","commenter_b":"I dont think its the color of our skin or were and how we ALL got here.

If you never handled pigs how can you say what is the best way to do it? if ya pick up a pig like a puppy it will struggle and squeal and put up a fight. but if ya hold it by a hind led it will settle down and let you handle it. The trucks they are on have multiple floors so yes you can get a lot of pigs on there, if they were less densely packed there would have been more mortality. and yes air can circulate. All you planet saver that think vegans are going to save the world, How much fossil fuel, fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, and other pollutants, are produced in the growing and harvesting of what you eat.","commenter_a":"Jamie Hall","post_message":"A semitrailer carrying 2,200 piglets overturned on a highway.

Problem solved.","commenter_a":"$7.25/hr equates to about $1250 a month before taxes. After taxes let's say $1000. I live in a studio apartment in CA and it's $885/mo. So $115 remains for 4 weeks of food, utilities, transportation to and from the job? Get real, America. Especially for a family even $15/hr would be a stretch, but it'd be better.","post_message":"It is a national disgrace that millions of full-time workers are living in poverty and millions more are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay their bills. A job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage."}]
