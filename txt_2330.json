Yes, Carson is entitled to his opinion but it shows the complete lack of understanding of the way our nation operates. A man who believes he can pick and choose which laws to obey is not qualified to run as President. Where are all the Christians who were crying about religious liberty? This man wants to take away the religious liberty of a very large portion of those practicing a different religion. A very sad day for America and those haters bashing the Muslim faith.","post_message":"A call for Dr. Ben Carson to drop out: @webpagelink"},{"comment_id":"767530393325420","commenter_b":"If employers are fined and punished who hire illegals and no welfare benefits were given to illegals, they'd have no incentive to be in the US and they go home..","commenter_a":"Senate Democrats need to stop being obstructionists!!!

I fear that Senate Democrats are playing politics with America's national security in an effort to protect the President's unconstitutional #executiveaction and to protect themselves from having to go on the record with their pro-#amnesty positions. #DontShutDownOurSecurity"},{"comment_id":"10153750514111336","commenter_b":"Why isn't the media reporting on the violent acts being perpetrated by these muslim 'refugees' in Europe?
