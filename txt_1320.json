When he can't run a business without filing for bankruptcy. You get no I screwed it up and need a do over in politics. Just ask GW Bush. Anyone hear Trumps policy other than he's going to be great. I I don't think so. Let's call him the carnival barker and clown show that he is. And his supporters if you don't like government than don't participate.
