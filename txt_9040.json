The immigration and Nationality Act passed June 27, 1952 revised the laws related to immigration and naturalization and nationality for the United States. The act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of congress regarding the immigration of aliens to the U.S. and remain in effect today. Among the many issues it cover, one in particular found in Chapter 2 section 212, the prohibition of entry to the U.S. if the alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by \"force, violence, or other unconstitutional means\" This, by it's very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.

No one wants to take the chance of harboring snakes on their own homeland, before long this migrant group would breed like crazy and before long their population would be 40 p.c or more and they might get some enlightenment and start bombing the locals.. The problem with most muslims, is they are always muslims first. They are not british, germans, australians, americans..There identity is muslim first and that's why its hard to trust loyalty of someone whose citizenship comes second to the God..These people can easily be blinded. From birth they are taught to prepare for heaven, if only they had such devotion for their mother land. Be it, wherever they are born, what ever citizenship they hold.
