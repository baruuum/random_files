For some reason White people think all Blacks feel as if every Black is innocent. I'm pretty sure Blacks feel as if all Whites think all Whites are innocent. That's not true and if having to state that we think this guy is thug helps then I'll summit to that. I don't think anyone really believes that condoning violence is OK if the person is the same color. People may be right or wrong but it's not necessary a race thing, I think they truly believe the person is innocent but are poorly informed.","post_message":"Robert Clark is wanted for murder and may be hiding in out Missouri.
