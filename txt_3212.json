Big problem in our country is young girls are getting pregnant, guys leaving, single mom/hard to get education, etc ----> leads to broken family structures/children not raised properly---> leading to most problems we are facing in our country","commenter_a":"She didn't have sex, she had intercourse, or made love. Her sex is female. Why must we depersonalize coitus, to like farting or blowing your nose?? Let's put the LOVE back into making love, then our kids might make the connection to a loving act that sometimes leads to pregnancy. It's supposed to belong to people who are committed not a spectator sport or a recreational past time. :)","post_message":"She handled them pretty well though."},{"comment_id":"1539781299650210","commenter_b":"Trump will CRUSH Hillary!!","commenter_a":"if you know Hillary will lose against Trump click like","post_message":"Wendy Long: Trump's 'America First' Platform Will Grow GOP Nationwide."},{"comment_id":"1328494547175243","commenter_b":"Join a lots of OTHERS, -- WHO could put up with that WOMAN.

No one deserves jail because of an unpaid weed ticket. Jail should only be for Killers, Rapists, and Burglars. Is that too much to ask?","commenter_a":"I see, so break the law, claim you're poor, and get away with breaking the law. Talk about \"privilege\". :/ Being poor is NOT a \"justification\" for not taking responsibility for one's own acts. No more than being rich is a \"justification\" for not being responsible for one's own acts. It's interesting how people complain that the rich aren't being held responsible for committing violations of the law, then claiming that the poor should NOT be held responsible. Rich person doesn't pay their taxes, they belong in jail. Poor person doesn't pay for legal fines and fees, they should just be entirely excused for breaking the law. Interesting.","post_message":"Kevin Thompson was jailed for five days because he couldn't afford to pay fines and fees from a traffic ticket.
