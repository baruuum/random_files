Especially when it was perpetrated by not one person living today. It isn't about keeping people from coming here, as my grandparents are immigrants. It's about how they go about doing it. There is a right way and a wrong way. I see it everyday, the advantages people take of a broken system. If you choose to leave your blinders on to facts, that is your choice. Ignorance is bliss.","commenter_a":"WOW... it's been over half a millennia and this story has repeated all over the globe throughout history affecting all people everywhere at some point or another. This shit is pathetic to bring up.","post_message":"Turns out..."},{"comment_id":"10153604770703984","commenter_b":"I know that Obama was slow to react. The main reason is the fallen were White and Hispanic soldiers killed by a Islamic terrorist. He has zero respect for our military and would be very happy if all military members that don't support his new direction for this country would resign. We have a President that wants to convert America into a third world country that will allow him to remain its Dictator. Everyone needs to remember the USSR and how it broke up into many small countries that are loaded with the rich leadership and the overtaxed people who just want to live in peace. Russia's streets are ruled by gangs and the mafia. WAKE UP AMERICA!!!","commenter_a":"Obama is some commander in chief NOT!! He should be ashamed! What happened to freedom of speech?","post_message":"What just happened in a crowd of veterans during an Obama speech says a lot about his presidency.

Unless her mental illness was so severe, that she couldn't have had the slightest idea that driving into a crowd of people was a BAD thing to do, then I don't think her being an angry, evil nut job is enough to let this thing off the hook.","commenter_a":"Is anyone surprised that Adacia Chambers already has a days-old Facebook support group?
