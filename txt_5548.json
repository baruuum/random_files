Building a wall where's that money coming from? not Mexico. Putting a 35% tariff on goods from China. Good move Trump and the China and other countries do the same to us. How about that lost American jobs?. You don't think Mexico buys from us? What about machinery, minerals, autos, trucks and military equipment anf farming equipment.","commenter_a":"Interestingly Trump praised all of Obama's policies. Now he says he's done a terrible job. He praised Hillary's job performance as Senator and Secretary of State and endorsed her for POTUS, now he calls her incompetent. Hmm. Should we really elect someone with such horrible judgement?","post_message":"In an interview today, Donald Trump said President Obama has done a \"terrible job\" in office and has allowed countries to take advantage of America. Is he right?"}]
