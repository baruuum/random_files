But if you want to talk about the Metro Detroit area as a whole there are some really beautiful women in the area. I was at Exodos rooftop (in Greektown) in the Summer a couple years back talking to a girl that was there from Philly and she said how good looking everyone was. The Albanian and Chaldean women in Metro Detroit are GORGEOUS. The city itself might not be the prettiest but there are some beautiful foreign women in the area. But I know the article wasn't just focused on the people.","post_message":"Detroit takes it on the chin in this survey based on nightlife, setting, hot locals and \"an undercurrent of desire.\""},{"comment_id":"10154450699361323","commenter_b":"Umm... because she's a woman!","commenter_a":".On what grounds does such a person NOT rather enter in the MALE-items?....","post_message":"\"It is unquestionably a sensitive and complicated issue and one that has arisen many times at the Olympics and other sporting competitions where it has been alleged that male athletes have attempted to compete as women or, in Caster Semenya’s case, that a woman has an intersex condition, which provides an alleged unfair advantage.\""},{"comment_id":"10153263072806323","commenter_b":"People are so ignorant.

It's simply ensuring that people of all body types and dimensions can dress in a style which they like, and in sizes which are comfortable and flattering to their shape. Besides, being overweight isn't as simple as being a 'lifestyle' - in many cases it can come from factors as diverse as metabolism, mobility issues, eating disorders or genuine dietary or medicine requirements.","post_message":"\"Saying that high-street stores shouldn’t “facilitate” certain human beings having access to clothing, in order to make them really understand how unacceptable they are as people, is pretty nasty, right?\""},{"comment_id":"10154078774989877","commenter_b":"Besides reproduction and parts which aren't anyone's business, nothing in these comments state what makes a woman a woman.","commenter_a":"We should all be okay with this.
