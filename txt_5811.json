It will keep out all the green eyed monsters!","commenter_a":"After the last couple of days, I feel it's time to throw my hat into the political ring. I'm forming a new party. The Free England From London Party. We have one proposal. To turn the M25 into a hundred foot wall and fill it with concrete. I'm not sure how we're gonna pay for it, so we're the same as all the other parties, however, I reckon a few Poles and Kurds will do it quite cheap and we could recycle bits of London to make the wall.

I suppose it depends on what one perceives as good pay the teacher I work with gets grants and other stipends but she also buys many things. My aunt who's taught for about 11 years in Arkansas buys many items but keeps her recipient for discounts and tax write offs I imagine you don't get nearly back what is put in. I subbed for a little over a year and I found myself buying many items I didn't care to file on my taxes even though the district gives you that option.

I will add I chose my profession after having my well behaved straight A children repeatedly coming home telling me their teacher was mean or did not appreciate their good behavior and Good citizenship. So I began to substitute and get an inside view. 68 job assignments later I saw many teachers that were jaded not just by the lack of parental involvement but by the lack of pay. I think more parents should better discipline and I also believe teachers lacked empathy and understanding. I will add prejudices and biases had a part as well.
