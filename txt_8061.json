This is a man, after all, who called a breastfeeding woman disgusting for needing to pump breast milk. Fun fact-Donald Trump is not the only man who has no idea what he's talking about in this arena. I had a friend who had to explain to a coworker, who was a father of THREE children, that breastfeeding women need to pump at work because they cannot start and stop lactation at will. Guy thought a breastfeeding coworker could just wait until her 8 hour shift was done to start lactating, and was disgusted that she stored her breast milk in the fridge.","commenter_a":"As a C-Section baby myself, I was scratching my head for a good long while after he said that.
