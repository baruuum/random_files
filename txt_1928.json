Don't worry about those pesky innocent bystanders and there's no need wasting tax dollars on a trial. Apparently stealing is an automatic death sentence. From diapers to Dodges citizens can now act as judge, jury and executioner.

However, that was not their aim ( no pun intended) - their 'aim' is to ban weapons period. Their question does not address any of the mitigating circumstances that surround each of the recent incidences of gun violence and they know it. You can see it in the eyes and expressions of the questionners once Miss S.C. gave her answer.","post_message":"Wow. I don't think ANYONE was expecting this...
