We were sending her to a private school until fifth grade,and we enrolled her in the public schools instead. I believe she had somewhat less homework in the public schools but it still seemed a lot. Children definitely need time to be children and to be able to play, make friends,and have free time.","post_message":"American school kids are drowning in homework compared to other countries.

Oh, and his favorite adviser - himself, his biggest fan - himself, his biggest fan - himself. Who else does he need? He's been saying all along that he will win without support. The truth is that, as much as I dislike these guys, they are basing this on principles. Laura, I used to have much more trust in you, but you've gone over too the dark side it seems.
