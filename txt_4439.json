I am not a fan of any of these idiots running. But Trump has got to go . People are gonna get hurt, innocent people. Look at the monsters he has as his security detail that will swing at anyone for no reason and now this with his supporters. The media has to stop covering him. Take away all the attention he is getting. Maybe cover him when something intelligent comes out of his mouth, which so far has been nothing. This man can say whatever he want but we are a democracy, we have a government and he rant about all he wants to do but he can't do it alone. There are 3 branches of government.
