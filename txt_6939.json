So many are military aged men. Why aren't they staying in their country and fighting to save it? Militant Islam is dangerous whether you agree to it or not. Letting these people into your country will diminish your country because these people will demand that you accommodate their religion and their way of life instead of them making an adjustment because they are guests. They will demand changes in established laws because they will not conform. These are not bigoted statements. These are facts that are easily verified.","commenter_a":"Why do militant atheists support the arrival of (militant?)
