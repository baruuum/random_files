Go stand near the them who lost legs. Listen to the stories of the PTSD stricken. Then come speak this hunger for war. I took an oath to support and defend this constitution. I have great pride when I see little American children stumble to daycare with their backpacks on. I also know, the threat to us doesn't lie in a desert. No donkeys can cross the ocean alive. It's in the profiteers. Those folk who rattle dangers but are too old to pick up arms. Defending our country has been my lifelong business, but I won't say it's been without questioning where the profit is going! Re-read Sodom and Gomorrah. It wasn't about being gay...it was about PRIDE and INHOSPITALITY both of which ...","commenter_a":"You all should do a little research on Trump, did you know that when his father died Trump stole his brother's inheritance and did not get anything to his brothers kids either. He is a greedy bastard. The pathetic part of all of this is that this ignorant population who is supporting him right now think that he is going to do more for them. He doesn't give a rats ass about any of them at all whatsoever. He would structure tax laws and policies that would for their benefit him once he left the White House if he ever made it to presidency. And all those morons who voted for him would sit there with their asses handed to them.","post_message":"LOL! Somewhere, Pres. Obama is rolling on the floor with laughter!

I hope you don't have an issue with the Native Americans because if it's true you should go back with you where you from.","commenter_a":"Why does the police have military style vehicles, why does the Native Americans still have to defend their land, why our government doesn't do anything about it.... Same old story oil companies rule the world.","post_message":"Watch as police in riot gear use pepper spray on activists protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Multiple were arrested.

This is going to be the biggest landslide in modern American history.","commenter_a":"My prediction in this election is that Trump will get a record number of votes beating Hillary. But Hillary will get the electoral vote giving her the presidency. The electoral is there so the establishment gets final say. Sad but true. Isn't that right Bernie Sanders.","post_message":"Donald J.
