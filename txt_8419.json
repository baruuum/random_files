The GOVERNMENT is taking advantage of illegals and will NEVER get rid of them lmfao. People such as yourself must educate yourselves on the topic. In which, may i add, you know nothing about. Furthermore, illegals PAY taxes which INCLUDE medicare and social security. The government KNOWS that they are working under Americans social security numbers and even submit them ALONG with their real name and address to apply for an ITIN number. This allows them to PAY taxes even though they are in fact illegal. And guess what??? They will NEVER alert the American that their social is being used, these \"illegals\" will NEVER see a dime of social security benefits Nor will YOU!! And oh ya....they CANT apply for medicare / welfare either. And WHY would the government not tell you your social is being used?? ...","commenter_a":"The question is why are illegals getting benefits instead of being deported. No longer should illegals receive benefits from our tax dollars. I read earlier our social security funds have been used for illegals benefits. I for one sure didn't pay into social security so a non citizen could receive these benefits.","post_message":"\"The American taxpayers have reached a boiling point.

Thanks for keeping us strong!","post_message":"Last night, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attempted to silence not only Senator Elizabeth Warren, but the late Coretta Scott King. It was a shameful attempt to stifle the thorough debate on President Trump’s nominees that the American people expect and deserve. I applaud Senator Warren and my Democratic colleagues in the Senate for fighting on behalf of the millions of Americans who have demanded that the next U.S. Attorney General be committed to upholding our most fundamental constitutional rights. In the battles to come, both in Washington and in communities nationwide, I urge my colleagues to follow Senator Warren’s lead—as she persisted last night, so must we. We do not have the right to remain silent."},{"comment_id":"2179339492291943","commenter_b":"Stick that thumb up your assssss.....","commenter_a":"Bang bang trumpty","post_message":"Trump wants guns in your classrooms, but not at his inauguration."}]
