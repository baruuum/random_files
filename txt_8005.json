Nobody asked you to have a child let alone breast feed let on too of that in PUBLIC! that's not cool. I just think others should be respectful of those around them instead just thinking about themselves which is what public breast feeders do...selfishly think about themselves and not the fact that they are disturbing everyone else. I do not want to be sitting somewhere and have someone's nasty ass breast out feeding a child nobody asked them to have. SORRY!","commenter_a":"I love Victoria's Secret and their model are gorgeous. All I will say is this: be considerate of others. Nobody wants to see someone's breasts all out...breast feeding or not. Idgaf what ones reasons for their breasts being exposed is, BE CONSIDERATE. You can pre pump your fucking milk. If that's the case than people should be able to walk around naked because it makes them comfortable and they mean no harm right?? lol oh...I thought so.","post_message":"With Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show starting soon, we thought it would be fitting to share one of our favorite moments from this show's important history.
