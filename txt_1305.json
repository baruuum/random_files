If it was, DoD finance screwed up AGAIN and will correct that issue shortly. They apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused.","commenter_a":"Not sure why people are complaining about buying them. That's what a CLOTHING ALLOWANCE is for. It's nothing new. We had to buy our own ACU's too when they came out. I used my Star Card to get a couple sets and then paid myself back with my clothing allowance. Pretty simple.","post_message":"Soldiers can start buying the newest camo pattern on July 1 – the one that looks strikingly similar to what soldiers have been wearing in Afghanistan for years."},{"comment_id":"482616358589904","commenter_b":"You mean white again.

And now this - one can only imagine what the likes of the Islamic State will do to our female soldiers."}]
