Thanks for your concern NYT but I'm doing just fine. I'm so sick of people telling me how disadvantaged I am as a woman. Women get alimony, the children, special scholarship opportunities, special mentorship opportunities, special conferences, support groups for violence against women, priority disembarking off the titanic, the seats on the crowed bus, and the list continues... Let's face it, men are disadvantaged now.","post_message":"While men often overvalue their strengths, women too frequently undervalue theirs.

He makes it easy for people to place the blame on him because, let's face it, he thinks he's smarter than he's capable of being. But, the vitriol and hate that is so easy to see NOW has always been there, simmering. Trump is a boil, a symptom of an untreated infection. People need to take a good look at themselves, their friends, their families, and their neighbors if they really want to understand the \"virus\" and the \"unreason\". It isn't as distant as Donald Trump.","post_message":"American history is littered with \"narcissistic demagogues who lie and distort in pursuit of power and self-promotion.

But, I wouldn't have chanced that. You never know when a preditor will change it's mind and attack. If it had decided to attack and start constricting around the child, they may have had trouble getting it off before it did harm, even with them watching. I don't think the child here is being abused or neglected, that obvious in the film. With all animals, things can go very wrong, very quickly.","post_message":"This video footage of a 14-month-old girl playing with the family pet might make you a little nervous."},{"comment_id":"10153871094319705","commenter_b":"@username guys, also keep your pants up, before an INDIAN decides to rape you !","commenter_a":"Only one religion is at the ROOT of so much misery on this planet...
