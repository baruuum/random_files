Our constitution was NOT set up that way, so please stop talking about it. IT DOESN\"T MATTER. Let me break it down for the simpletons. Suppose you live in a homeowners association. If there is an issue, each home has 1 vote, decision is made fairly. However, if it was a \"popular vote\", then each resident would have a say. If you lived by yourself, you'd possibly be outvoted by your neighbors who had a houseful of 5 people, everytime there was a vote. Which would you prefer? That's how our republic is set up: each state has a FAIR vote in electing the president. Forget the popular vote, unless we change the constitution.","post_message":"Liberals did not like what Ann Coulter tweeted."}]
