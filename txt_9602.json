Feminists just want complete gender equality!","commenter_a":"I'm pretty sure that most men aren't like \"rape is so cool bruh, I'm going raping this weekend bruh, you coming?\" Stop lol And not all men get all \"EEEEEKKK\" about periods. Personally, I can listen to my female friends talk about it and not even get slightly sick.","post_message":"\"Imagine if men were as disgusted with rape as they are with periods.\""},{"comment_id":"10152836781859117","commenter_b":"Couldnt agree more. My sister had to go take a nursing exam the day after her 6 year old son died. Then missed the following exam for his funeral and had to make up the days the following weekend.

THERE WILL BE MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, MORE DRUG ISSUES, MORE CRIME, MORE HOMELESSNESS, MORE TRAUMA.. THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER BUT IF THERE WAS A LIVING WAGE PUT IN PLACE WE WOULD HAVE LESS PEOPLE ON WELFARE THAT IS A GIVEN. TOO EASY..","commenter_a":"Velocity of Money: I think it's quite simple if you look at something called velocity of money. What does that mean? That is the money that gets spent back into the economy. When you have the top 1% getting money, they spend 5-10% of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend 100-110% of what they earn. Since we are a consumer economy this will be good for business in the long term. Not for the people getting the $15 per hour.","post_message":"An economist explains why Clintonâ€™s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 might be 'too much, too quickly.'"},{"comment_id":"1152094041550315","commenter_b":"This is Trump he's racist or rapists he brings crime and does drugs is insane and sometimes maybe nice but lies all the time!
