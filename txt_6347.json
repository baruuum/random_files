Two people in love that want to get married would never choose someone to marry them that was not accepting of them. There are many other clergy accepting out there. Not all WANT religious rites. Civil ceremonies performed are the legal ones that count. Not one person (straight or gay) can get married in the church without that civil license first. People are getting totally out of hand on this. The church is going to do what they want anyway.
