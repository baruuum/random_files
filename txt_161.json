Burkas would improve these types, so no, let them wear burkas.","commenter_a":"The thing is that it is part of their religion and I think we should respect their right to wear it, it is not indecent.

CEA finds what economists would call “increasing marginal costs” of delay. If we don’t make a concerted effort to keep the rise in average global temperature within the range consistent with modest costs and instead allow it to stabilize one degree Celsius higher, the annual additional damages would equal 0.9 percent of global output. A longer delay that added another degree would cause additional annual damages of 1.2 percent of global output. That’s a total change of 2.1 percentage points. To illustrate those annual costs more tangibly, 2.1 percent of current U.S. GDP, which is about a fifth of world output, is roughly $360 billion. The story doesn’t end there, however. There’s a lot of uncertainty around these estimates. Acting sooner rather than later is insurance against unpleasant surprises.
