This post is another poor attempt to win votes for Cruz. If Killery or Bernie win the Second Amendment is in trouble as will be the first.

Reagan granted amnesty in the 80's and it was to be a one time thing for those already here. Settled once and for all. But they keep coming. And this problem is not just from Hispanics although they make up the majority of inflow. If they couldn't come legally then they shouldn't be here. People have been coming legally for 100 years (like my father and his parents). No excuses. They are breaking the law and need to be deported.","commenter_a":"All he has is big ego","post_message":"Dude!
