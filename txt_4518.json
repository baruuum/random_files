And all you idiots commenting on my stupid comment as if I'm serious lol What's even more ridiculous is \"the police have to do their jobs\". So that's why some ppl get Burger King and walked out of a building (when they've killed 9ppl) and other ppl get choked to death for selling loose cigs, or get shot to death on site for having a toy gun (a 12 year old btw). Or others mysteriously die by being shot in the back while cuffed and in the back of a cop car. Yea cops totally just doing their job by the books. So yea, thanks for \"proving\" me wrong on a comment that was clearly not serious to begin with. You butthurt idiots can shut your dick holsters and relax.","commenter_a":"Prolly told him \"good job son, you played your role perfectly. You did a good job as patsy for your government.
