The media should try to hide the identities of poor kids like this baby. She definitely needs shooting a few times at least.","commenter_a":"I have not seen the video nor do I want to. Y on earth is it here for everyone to see!? What is there to gain from displaying a horrific video of a child being abused? The story should be published but when this poor child grows up and sees that this video has been seen by millions how do u think he/she will feel?

It's the very nature of Islam that poses the problem isn't it? Do you really want to populate your country with people who follow a religion that is also a supremacist ideology? Is it your argument that it's hate that motivates people to not want to allow mass immigration of people that follow this system of belief? I would say that's a very irresponsible and naive view. Who do you have a greater duty to? If you think it's to the millions of immigrants living in countries with terrible histories of violence, terrorism, misogyny, and rape I have to say that is not kindness at all. Don't you understand that real people in your country are going to die and get raped because people think like you? Where do you draw the line.

She is then ordered to return again, and the judge becomes furious with her attitude. “Did you say ‘f--- you’? Did you say that?” the judge asks. “Yes sir, I did,” the girl responds. “Oh you did say that?” the judge replies. “I find you in direct criminal contempt.
