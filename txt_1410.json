Well what did you know the whole world is putting blames on a company instead of the provider. Talented consumers indeed. Personally the problem probably lies with the performance output and the batteries supplying the phone.

That means no law can be withheld or upheld based on religious beliefs.... she made an oath to follow the laws of the US , as soon as the laws ...","post_message":"Defiant Court Clerk, Kim Davis, Will Be Held In Jail Until She Agrees To Issue Same-Sex Marriage Licenses!
