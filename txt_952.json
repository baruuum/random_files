Those mother's present the mother And father role. Having two mothers appears to be a blessing! :) Children need love, structure and room for growth. So, haters just sit down and if you love children so much the foster care and group homes have many of your neglected and abused children waiting to be adopted and loved.","post_message":"Yes, they're both pregnant, but about a year apart..."},{"comment_id":"1180082675403600","commenter_b":"What a bitch and she says she is going to help the less fortunate! What a joke!","commenter_a":"And she has been for decades. So sad that so many black people are so clueless. This lying thieving dirt bag couldn't care less about anything but your vote.","post_message":"Talk about something the media will never show us.

Instead of political correctness, he has validated Carson correctness! Too weak and lame to be a strong leader for a strong country. I like Mr Carson, but well intentions don't hold water in this crucial period in our country.","post_message":"\"I don’t want to see tyranny occur here,\" Dr. Ben Carson told This Morning, adding that \"we can’t always assume that\" good people will be leading our country."},{"comment_id":"884379288251594","commenter_b":"Sexy diva girl","commenter_a":"Nache Mishell","post_message":"[Watch] ABC Unveils Sneak Peeks For The Return Of TGIT @webpagelink Speaking of good TV...who's ready for Scandal and HTGAWM?"},{"comment_id":"10152952742422507","commenter_b":"I don't see how feeling guilty about things that happened hundreds of years ago has anything to do with what's happening now. Especially when it was perpetrated by not one person living today. It isn't about keeping people from coming here, as my grandparents are immigrants. It's about how they go about doing it. There is a right way and a wrong way. I see it everyday, the advantages people take of a broken system. If you choose to leave your blinders on to facts, that is your choice.
