She shouldn't have touched her. She appeared to be shielding her head and face as she was pounced on. Then, she gets in her car, probably not thinking rasionaly and overwhelmed by the incident, she blacked out and just lost it. She definitely was not acting in her right mind. She felt shielded in her car and since she couldn't beat them all up, took it to a whole new level. Neither of their actions are justifiable but that big girl needs to be taught a lesson to never ever touch anyone or beat on anyone like that ever again. Clearly, fatso is from the ghetto and couldn't control herself.","post_message":"A parking lot brawl between two women over a parking spot quickly turned into a demolition derby.
