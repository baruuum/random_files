If you never handled pigs how can you say what is the best way to do it? if ya pick up a pig like a puppy it will struggle and squeal and put up a fight. but if ya hold it by a hind led it will settle down and let you handle it. The trucks they are on have multiple floors so yes you can get a lot of pigs on there, if they were less densely packed there would have been more mortality. and yes air can circulate.
