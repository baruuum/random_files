You put a cover over your mind and give thanks that mothers can feed portably whilst not being excluded. I'm sure you can train your mind to manage to view a pair of breasts as a feeding devise and look at how your own mind processes this function.

Because I'm American hispanic and I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, and his supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the \"Trump Strong\" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Strong Again! Thank you.","post_message":""}]
