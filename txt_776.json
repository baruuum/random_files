Or does it represent something else? See, that's the beauty of this flag. It holds different values for different people. You don't value yourself, others, anything? You more then likely will despise what I say and verbally attack me.You blindly support atrocities committed by our shit-for-brains leaders, you'll probably verbally attempt to attack me.

Rather then protest, why don't you offer to help those poor, confused girls seeking an abortion? Perhaps these women feel they have no other option. So why don't you offer to help them out, since you love babies so much? Offer to take these girls in & give them an alternative, especially since a lot of them fear that their family is going to shun them due you to this unplanned pregnancy. Then, pay for all of their medical bills for all the doctor visits they'll need, including the hospital birth. Then, while the mother recovers at YOUR house, you can raise the baby you desperately wanted to save when she leaves to go on with the life that she wanted to live. I think that would work.
