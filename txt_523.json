I know the deportation is not feasible - but it could be done but I know it won't happen - but we most certainly should deport the criminals who are here illegally. Illegals should have NO RIGHTS - first of all they break the law when they enter here. I'm voting for Trump. Mr. Kasich - what about OUR rights? Do the citizens of America have any rights ? are we protected any more? Now, what's happened is that these illegals are stuck here - that's why we MUST STOP IT. We cannot support the entire world no matter how sympathetic we are to them.","commenter_a":"The strong leader is not @username......he says deporting 20 million illegals is inhumane! You're part of the problem! How patriotic can you be, how much can you love your country to condone an invasion by 20 million illegals into our country that is now a welfare state with very high unemployment. The 11 million came from the 2010 census.....but many hispanics refused to answer the questionaire out of fear.....also, since 2010, millions more have come acrtoss the border. It's 20 million, folks!","post_message":"America deserves a strong leader back in the White House.
