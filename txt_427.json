Donny Trump and his lackeys DO NOT get to redefine what a conservative is. Many many real conservatives have fought hard, long battles over the decades to pull this nation back onto the constitutional rails advocating for founding principles. This fight has always been against politicians of the democrat party and republican establishment put there in part with Donny Trump donations. Where was Donny when some were standing tall against amnesty? Where was Donny when some were fighting Obamacare? Where was Donny when some were fighting to get Planned Parenthood defunded? Where was Donny when a certain someone was fighting the unconstitutional DC gun ban? Where was Donny when average citizens were having their homes confiscated by local governments so rich people could use them instead...............

The solution that they put the fetus in does not destroy it. If that was the case every placenta, product of conception, etc, would be destroyed! Most product/tissue that comes from one's body goes into some sort of formalin. And about them giving you back tissue/poc, that will never happen. I don't believe any hospital will be like oh here, you can have your 19 week demised fetus. It's not going to happen.. That's like saying you want your uterus when they take it out. Someone told you a load of crap if that is really what transpired.","commenter_a":"I find that hard to believe. They have protocols to follow when it comes to medical waste. Right?
