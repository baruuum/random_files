Will his supporters begrudgingly acknowledge defeat in the public forum of a democratic vote? Will they accept hat their ideas and policies, such as they are, are not accepted by the majority of their fellow citizens? I don't believe they will. And what then? Will they turn to other methods to advance political ideas that cannot be achieved through conventional democratic means? And what will we call them then...?","post_message":"Josh Marshall \"You can say all sorts of things about these folks being crazy, or extremists or whatever else.
