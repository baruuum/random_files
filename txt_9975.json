Lawyers can find many ways of getting people out of trouble. Bet the girl didn't show remorse or learn an important lesson.","commenter_a":"Ok, fine people for smoking around children. Then let's raise the fines for texting and driving and add fines for talking and driving. These fines can be used to further aid in our children's education. But most important-people can use their lessons they learned in driver's ed such as using a turn signal and stopping at a stop sign.","post_message":"Should smokers be fined for smoking in cars with kids?

Even if he does half of what he said he'd do it will be HUGE!! Id be happy with getting rid of illegal criminals, upholding the laws we have and securing the border and building the wall!
