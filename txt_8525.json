People came from other towns and cities with food and other things that were badly needed during this time. I understand these ladies went above and beyond and for that I applaud them.

Brazil has the world's most strict gun laws, yet people die almost every minute of the day due to gun violence there. You know why? BECAUSE CRIMINALS DON'T OBEY LAWS! That Oregon campus was a gun free zone in an area where open carry is legal. No one would have the guts to go on a shooting spree anywhere but in a gun free zone. Anytime there is a tragedy like thus, the Democrat solution is always more government tyranny.
