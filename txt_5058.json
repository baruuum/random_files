Put her on the defense from the beginning and she stayed there. She just gave America that fake smile like she always does and then pretends everything is just perfect. Give me a break! I know she was extremely angry with some of the truthful comments Trump was saying and I could see that in her facial expressions. If it wasn't for the liberal media Trump would be miles ahead!","post_message":"#KenBone's overnight fame was fueled by his snazzy red sweater, white shirt-tie combination, his thick mustache, his disposable camera and of course, his catchy name, according to social media."},{"comment_id":"1014609198628438","commenter_b":"She s the normal one!","commenter_a":"Oh I think this woman should be arrested and taken into custody as she is obviously a sociopath with a gun!!","post_message":""},{"comment_id":"1796936270580308","commenter_b":"She is so low a snake would have to slither over her. #Hillaryforprison www.clintonkaine.com","commenter_a":"Go Hillary !

These were outlier polls. The AP is a 14 pt spread in favor of Hillary. If they don't make this look like a horse race the last week or so, people won't watch. Nate Silver pointed this out last night. Go check out 538 polls. Imagine 100s of weather models predicting a snow storm predominately tracking east and 1 or 2 suddenly say west. Those are outliers and not a reflection of the whole. People are in here all excited bc they don't know what they are looking at.","post_message":"JUST IN: Florida and Nevada move back to Donald J.
