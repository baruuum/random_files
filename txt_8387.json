Maybe $8 start out and earn your raise, but not $15. If you want to make money in the food industry, become a server. Yeah, we make $2.13 and hr (yes our minimum wage hasn't changed in DECADES) but I work part time for full time pay as I call it. I work 3-5 hr a day which give s plenty of family time and can make $15+ an hr from tips off the table. That is how we pay our bills for those of you who feel tipping is dumb. My $2.13 pays the taxes and the smallest check I've gotten was 10 cents, some don't even get checks.","post_message":"\"We need you out there leading the fight ...\""},{"comment_id":"986959091402697","commenter_b":"Your wife?","commenter_a":"Twat","post_message":"The poll shows a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump."},{"comment_id":"1114612235259607","commenter_b":"So wait, now they don't WANT jobs?
