Imagine believing that and being expected never to mention it. I actually don't mention it, because I've found that people simply do not give a fuck about the suffering of animals, and it is far too depressing to endure such conversations. But it continues to irritiate me when people say, it's fine, just don't push your views on others.","post_message":"Russell Simmons, founder of Def Jam and author of \"The Happy Vegan\", teaches us how to defend the plant-based diet that many love to hate."},{"comment_id":"1642335606053552","commenter_b":"It's a shame what Obama has done...","commenter_a":"We'll See If You Mock Jesus When He Returns For All Us CHRISTIANS!
