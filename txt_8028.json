She never even mentioned his name... She is just addressing him along with all the other boys out there who do this. Something similar happened to me when I was in grade school and instead of having my back, all my friends labeled me as a bitch for not giving this guy a chance. He WAS harassing me but it was seen as \"cute\" because women are taught to appreciate male attention no matter the circumstances. We are taught it is the best thing that could ever happen to us. Just bear in mind that if a teenage daughter willingly comes to her mother for help, during a time when most teens seek distance from their parents, there is clearly a huge problem. This is video that can help a lot of other parents and teens ...","post_message":"This mom has a message for the boy repeatedly being rejected by her 14-year-old daughter: No means no."},{"comment_id":"695333573948652","commenter_b":"@username you are wants wrong with lawless America.

When I was 14 I lived off of 14th and Pierce by Casa Bonita....and had to catch the bus on Colfax for school. If I would have reported every dude who cat called, they would have needed a daily report for me alone on the news. I'm really not trying to down play the fact that this guy could have been a weirdo but this seems a little extreme.","post_message":"Keep an eye out, Colorado.
