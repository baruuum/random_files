This is not a gun ban. It's apples and oranges. This is simply sensible purchase laws.","commenter_a":"The answer to something like this is not more laws imposed by a federal government. It never works, it never will. Did prohibition prevent alcohol consumption? After prohibition alcohol became more dangerous to consume; crime increased and became ; the court and prison systems were stretched to the breaking point; and corruption of public officials was rampant. Prohibition removed a significant source of tax revenue and greatly increased government spending. It led many drinkers to switch to opium, marijuana, patent medicines, cocaine, and other dangerous substances that they would have been unlikely to encounter in the absence of Prohibition. Now we have the \"War on Drugs\" has that worked? Has Lyndon B Johnson's war on Poverty reduced poverty?

Science has proven that life begins at conception. Social injustices continue such as poverty, hunger, underemployment, and child abuse has actually increased. Killing innocent life has not and will not solve these problems. Women and men suffer terrible regret for a decision that can never be reversed. They need real help and healing. The website hopeafterabortion.com offers loving help to post abortive women. Prolife Pregnancy Care Centers offer free nonjudgmental, loving support whether a woman decides to give birth or abort.

It is their body and their right. A fetus that cannot process a though does not trump the right over an already born human being, especially when it lacks a social security card, birth certificate, valid first and last name, etc. A fetus does not reserve the right to life over the person it feeds off of and needs for survival.
