It will not come to that because Bernie will win as he has the people behind him. They have done everything to suppress Bernie but they will fail. If she steals the nomination with the help of the corrupt DNC and the corporate media then please do as I and many other liberal progressives and take the Bernie or bust pledge. It is way past voting for the lesser of two evils. I refuse to be bullied into supporting her when I know that she is basically a GOP lite and if she is nominated we will lose.
