Once they reach \"refugee\" status they can roam throughout America without any restrictions. Refugee is just a word to make it look right........it is not. Illegals are just criminals and not the best for our country. The new immigrants are not the same that came over after WWII who felt blessed and were willing to be woven into the fabric of America. The new ones are coming for only the money and the Demos are only aiding and abetting them for the votes. Plain and simple.","commenter_a":"Trump is the biggest liar out there. \"We did not discuss paying for the wall\" - Trump \"I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" - Nieto \"Chicago Police told me crime will stop in one week\" - Trump \"We did not discuss stopping crime in one week\" - Chicago PD \"The NFL sent me a letter about the presidential debates\" - Trump \"We did not send any letter to Trump\" - NFL Promises on deportation of illegal immigrants, self-funding of his campaign, no teleprompter, muslim ban, and release of his tax returns, now confirmed LIES.
