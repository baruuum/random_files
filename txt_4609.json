I have ave some reservations. If she were to win how could she govern effectively? With zero green party reps and senators to assist her. For the green party to be effective we would need down ticket victories also. I don't like Hillary Clinton! I absolutely fear Donald Trump. Voting green in 2000 gave us GWB. That is NOT debatable those that don't accept that are just in denial. Jill's platform is in accordance with my beliefs. I do think that her promise to put Snowden on her cabinet is pure pandering. That troubles me.

I wasn't raised like that. That's not my calling. I'm just being truthful. It'd be a violation of my own limited sense of moral integrity and spiritual conscience.
