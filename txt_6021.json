Her eyes are always squinted, and her lips are always tight. I mean it is not a happy look. This is not a rant because she is female, and it is not a comment on her worth or attractiveness. It is a comment on how people show expression in their face. She doesn't look happy at all.","post_message":"Could you imagine the right-wing reaction if the Obamas did this?"},{"comment_id":"10153588638028203","commenter_b":"Really an evil woman.

It is occurring in mainstream and leading mosques world-wide, including at one of the most important religious institutions in Islam, the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem."},{"comment_id":"10154162897758855","commenter_b":"@username I was fondled by an obnoxious straight woman at a bachelorette party at a gay bar.
