Legal and citizen Hispanics support him because liberals want to keep the illegals to keep wages down. Just like the South wanted to keep slaves for cheap labor. Guess who's hiring underpaid illegals for farming? California!","commenter_a":"The Anti-Defamation League is dead on. There were people with guns that stood up to the Nazis and they were wiped out with brutality. Additionally Hitler campaigned a lot like Trump promising to make Germany great again, riding into power on nationalism. Hitler sold the ubermensch and the German people bought it and you can't have superman without inferior beings to crush. European Jews were the scapegoats he needed, he pinned all German problems on them. Hitler preached that it was their fault, they were the reason Germany wasn't as great as it should be and Germans bought it. (Does that song sound familiar?) Every German could have ten guns and Hitler still would have come to power.","post_message":"Presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson Carson said that he believed \"the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\""}]
