If a diamond ring is a deal breaker for a woman she needs a reality check","commenter_a":"Thank fuck I have a husband who knew when he was proposing to me that I'm not a shallow twit who will only accept diamonds :) Also to those who say you don't get the sparkle with a fake, let me tell you, you do, you get sparkle in abundance, just because its \"fake\" doesn't mean its not good quality!! My rings catch many an eye and always oh that must of cost a lot bla bla bla, as far as I would be concerned my advice to men would be that if she DEMANDS a diamond she is not worth it :)","post_message":"Put a diagram on it."},{"comment_id":"10154154880759087","commenter_b":"And if Bill's affairs are on the table, so are Melania's published nude photos, including her lesbian poses.","commenter_a":"Stupid people can't even see that their party is in shambles because of this animal. PS- Bill isn't running for President, HRC is. If you're gonna judge spouses for their lack of control or influence in their marriages, then where's your criticism of Melania?","post_message":"\"They will elect Donald Trump and Mike Pence because they know that this is our last chance to keep our nation from plunging over the cliff into an abyss of debt, weakness, and servitude.\""},{"comment_id":"10154391312414614","commenter_b":"I think these pro illegals group should pay the billions it's costing Americans, show their support that way......","commenter_a":"Annndd I don't care.","post_message":"\"We wanted to point out that while he seems to think he can say what he likes in one place and not hear about it elsewhere, he is wrong,\" said one Scottish protester, referring to Trump's controversial comments about Mexican immigrants. point of the flag is to show solidarity with the Mexicans and every other group that Trump has decried, derided, insulted and tried to marginalize, said David Milne, a member of the Tripping Up Trump campaign."},{"comment_id":"1401035306583488","commenter_b":"Trump was sneaking in another drug shipment.","commenter_a":"Well government systems are remarkably insecure compared to the sensitivity of information on them.

She also has to take a truckload of pills every day in order to make sure she gets enough nutrients so she won't have other health problems from not eating enough. Anyone doing any research on gastric by-pass will find that it's not the solution to weight loss, and in some cases, they're much worse off than before. This woman isn't so fat that she can't lose the weight on her own. The problem is she doesn't want to lose weight. If your \"want to\" isn't there, even gastric by-pass won't be very effective. I personally know 3 women who have had this surgery & they've all gained whatever weight the lost ...","post_message":"This woman says sheâ€™s too fat to work, so the government offered to pay for weight loss surgery.
