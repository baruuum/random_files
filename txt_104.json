Please don't insult the intelligence of Bernie Sanders supporters. We know the difference and you sir are just trying to fear monger ppl into thinking that.","commenter_a":"Perhaps Bernie will be made to answer tough questions on his absurd views on governance. Bernie Sanders: A demagogue is on the rise The populist fever is now running rampant. A demagogue is on the rise. His appeal is founded in the notion that the professional political class has both failed and ignored the plight of a disaffected but vocal minority. In terms of substance, he leaves much to be desired. In style, however, he captivates and inspires. On the debate stage, he touts his surging poll numbers, spouts unrealistic but tantalizing anti-elitist policy preferences, and berates the moderators for asking him tough questions all to the cheers of his committed band of malcontents.
