There are some crashes that you can be in that you won't survive if you were wearing an armored suit. Its proven fact that everywhere they have changed the laws regarding wearing helmets deaths have increased. It happens around here a lot and most of the deaths are caused by head trauma, no helmet.","commenter_a":"what a tragic irony!","post_message":"A state lawmaker who voted to repeal universal helmet laws has died in a motorcycle crash.

Louisiana is commonly referred to as a \"gun loving state.\" The only necessary requirement for purchase is a valid driver's license, which can prove the buyer meets the federal age limits: 21 for handguns and 18 for shotguns or rifles. There is no gun permit required to purchase a firearm in the state, nor is a gun license mandatory to detail ownership. Registration of long guns or handguns is also not required under Louisiana law. There are no restrictions on long guns in the state; the only areas where an individual cannot carry a loaded shotgun or rifle are on college campuses, or properties that specifically designate the barring of weapons. Areas such as schools, hospitals, municipalities, and places of worship often disallow carrying privileges. It is also permissible to transport loaded long guns ...","post_message":"Gov.
