Problem is that people are so selfish, narcissistic, and apathetic that they don't really LOOK at a person until its too late. Did I mention lazy?

No wonder Hillary Clinton is the great destroyer of State Department emails. One can assume that Mrs. Clinton would not have stolen and destroyed emails in violation of law and various court orders if she didn have something to hide. And it shouldn take a federal court order to find out that Hillary Clinton evidently had no clue how the State Department and the FBI responded to terrorist attacks on State Department personnel."},{"comment_id":"10153423597850779","commenter_b":"Who is that chick on the left","commenter_a":"Sasha Banks, who is the by far the best wrestler male or female in the WWE, is Snoop's first cousin.
