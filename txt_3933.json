My point is why go to a frat house that is known for Alcohol drugs and loose women having sex up stairs, when you know inappropriate things always happen in places like that. Secondly, I'm sure she was there drinking in an unsafe environment but I don't condone anyone being raped but we should ask ourselves why the Hell do women keep going to places that are historically unsafe for women? Lastly, women lie so much about rape and other things that no one knows when they are telling the truth. There has been several times when men have been falsely accused of rape and we found out later that she was just trying to cover up the fact that she decided to sleep with the whole football team at once. I see the police reports ...","commenter_a":"Ok but why was she even there in the first place?!!!!!!

Jesus did not need a million dollars to spread the Word of God and there is no other as Him. Nor did his disciples. They taught the Word and lived the Word and never did they live as lavishly as these preachers. Many of you are saying that IRS should not get involved and the people should do something about it. The problem is that no one is and the blatant greed and lavish lifestyles is out of control - and what is the absolute worst- it is all done \"in the name of the Lord\". Sorry folks, these are not churches. They are tax free money making machines that feed off of very good hearted Christian people that just want to do their best to live according to the Word and these \"preachers\" know just what ...","post_message":"I can't believe this is happening.
