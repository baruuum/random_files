I refuse to vote for a disgusting womanizer who cares nothing about this country and I also refuse to vote for a woman who has covered up her husband's sexual assaults and has allowed troops and ambassadors to die on her watch. They are both liars and cheats and I will pray for this country everyday until either one of them is finally out of office.","commenter_a":"Hillary Clinton","post_message":"Women Voters Only: Your Choice for President?"},{"comment_id":"10154034476612144","commenter_b":"@username you are a freaking trumpette woman which is disgusting.

Then point out she has released decades of tax returns and when is he going to pony up like a real candidate.

I don't represent the US government. The US government doesn't represent me. I don't excuse all of the bad things the crooks who call themselves \"my government\" do. And none of that excuses crimes Israel commits. Including the subversion of my country's government via AIPAC and all of its spies, such as the traitor Jonothan Pollard, and dual-citizen Israeli loyalists in positions of influence and power. If you don't like the crimes my country has commited in the Middle East since 9/11, you can attribute a big part of the blame on Israel and its subversives in the US. Not all, but a big part.","commenter_a":"The excuse is always the same. A missile from Gaza lands harmlessly into the Israeli desert. Israel bombs the hell out of Gaza, killing dozens or hundreds of civilians. When are people going to wake up to this scam. Israeli agents shoot off the missile to provide a pretext for Israel's aggression.","post_message":"URGENT"}]
