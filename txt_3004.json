Ugh","commenter_a":"Jeff Sessions was that racist that prosecuted the KKK and has many black friends who defend him, yet Senator Warren throws the racist term around while pretending to be a native American? I don't get it. If you just hate someone just say it. Calling him a racist simply makes Ms Warren a racist and someone who stole from native Americans in order to further her financial coffers.
