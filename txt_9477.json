So that your tax dollars can feed him, cloth him and pay for the medicine when he is sick. There is already a fence up and they scale it. If you build a bigger wall then they will just dig tunnels.","commenter_a":"Governor, I've always respected you. I voted for you when you ran for president eight years ago, and I was proud to cast that vote. That said, wouldn't it be better to have him arrested and locked away where he can't do any more harm, regardless of what side of the border he's on? I'm concerned that having a \"deport the criminals\" stance fuels a xenophobic mentality that all illegal immigrants are dangerous criminals. Also, there's no way to ensure he stays deported for good, even with a wall. Lastly, it seems to imply that if he's a danger to society that we don't care about the lives of people outside of our borders. Aren't humans worthy of human dignity regardless of what side of the border they're on? Imprisonment seems like the best option. I'm genuinely curious, and would appreciate an honest, civil discussion.","post_message":"Prayers today for the family of North Texas firefighter Captain Peter Hacking, who was killed along with his four-year-old stepdaughter and 22-month-old son when a van veered into their lane and hit their car head-on. If the van driver recovers, heâ€™ll be charged with criminally negligent homicide. Letâ€™s hope thatâ€™s also enough to get him deported for good, since heâ€™s an illegal immigrant who was already deported in 2008, but came right back across the border. Normally, Iâ€™d link to a news site for more, but Iâ€™d rather that you read it here.

It's not only Africa's problem this is a world wide issue. Next time you hear a piano play or go to the pub to play some billiards question what they are made of. Ivory poaching legally ended in 1989, but the demand will always be there and countries like China and Japan will always buy their way through these bans as long as we keep buying tacky souvenirs from Asia containing Ivory. Education is the key, we have to take an interest and ask what is the item I'm about to purchase made from? This is what we can do to reduce the demand of items made from threatened species.","post_message":"Poachers, beware.
