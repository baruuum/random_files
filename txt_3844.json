All these gorilla whisperers and no one have any knowledge on gorilla other than from the television. The mother is 95% to blame and the zoo is 5% to blame. No way should a 4yr. old be able to find his way in there. However since he did, no one knows what the gorilla was going to do next. Saving the child should have been the first and only priority (and it was) not the gorilla. Sad the gorilla had to die but not only should humans come first but it was a baby. Some people are really crazy.","post_message":"A gorilla was killed to save a child at the Cincinnati Zoo over the weekend. But there was a much different outcome when a little boy fell into a gorilla pit at an Illinois zoo nearly 20 years ago.

Anyone applauding a man loosing a fortune for standing up for his beliefs is soiling their own humanity. By ruining his life, you are staining your own soul. All of you are behaving much worse than anything you are accusing him of (falsely I might add). Those lambasting him are the ugly ones. I have seen much more vulgar behavior from the anti-trump crowd than anything that has been used as ammunition against him, true or not (most of it is false).","post_message":"The numbers say that Trump casinos, stores, and golf courses have suffered most."},{"comment_id":"10154892673543690","commenter_b":"@username Yeah I get it, I'm just evil with white supremacy and global domination on my mind. Nobody with brown or black skin anywhere outside the United States is capable of doing anything wrong, because of white people, right? You're just a victim? I wasn't in the Navy, I am a Marine. But I feel like I have to defend the Navy here. There are sailors representing men and women from every race, not just whites. I guess you didn't know that. You say that the US Navy contributes to human misery but when a tsunami struck Indonesia in 2004, who was there for the rescue effort? When an earthquake struck Nepal, who was there? When a hurricane destroyed Haiti, who was there? I was there distributing food and medical supplies to desperately poor people in Ethiopia and Somalia.

Ive never oppressed anyone and I Judge people based on the content of their character. I still hear all over the media how I, and people like me, are causing all the problems in this world.
