She just encourages them to get abortions so they can go back to their life and most likely get pregnant again.","commenter_a":"So here's an actual SOLUTION for all the pro-life people... Rather then protest, why don't you offer to help those poor, confused girls seeking an abortion? Perhaps these women feel they have no other option. So why don't you offer to help them out, since you love babies so much? Offer to take these girls in & give them an alternative, especially since a lot of them fear that their family is going to shun them due you to this unplanned pregnancy.

You put a cover over your mind and give thanks that mothers can feed portably whilst not being excluded. I'm sure you can train your mind to manage to view a pair of breasts as a feeding devise and look at how your own mind processes this function.
