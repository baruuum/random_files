They take the risk just like any other man serving. You assume that a lot of women would want to jump in to combat roles over the 'safer' ones. Some might, yes. Not all. Just like having the Ranger tab it does not mean you will be in a Ranger regiment. Women are not afforded all paths in leadership like men are. I never said the standards should be lowered, did I? Nope. I VERY CLEARLY said \"If these women could not pass at the lower standards, then they have no business being part of it. So, they didn't make the cut, and yet you're still pissed off? \".

They already lowered the standards for SEALs because of their little 5 year project that ended in 2015! They had to lower the standards and give them \"step boxes\" to complete the courses! What a crock of crap! Even at lowering the standards NO FEMALE PASSED! Certain \"jobs\" in the military should be left to the men! Females will put soldiers lives at risk when they get shot, twist an ankle, break a nail or just have a bad case of PMS!

The Clintons are incensed at Americans and think they are trolls or deplorable or predators or worthless. What the Clintons really desire is to add to their greedy pot of wealth built on the backs of slaves; modern day, contemporary slavery which includes a melting pot of all races. TRUTH: Hillary's economic plan seeks to further these greedy ambitions of gain and puts all of America and every American citizen at risk. By allowing an influx of immigrants including the 11 million (maybe astronomically more) to stay illegally, unconstitutionally, your wages will decrease or stagnate while your costs of living rise: You will be forced to compete with these new immigrants for housing, your prices on everyday purchases will rise, over ...","commenter_a":"Trump founded Racist Birtherism","post_message":"A senior ISIS leader was killed earlier this month in a precision strike near the Syrian city of Raqqa, a U.S. official told Fox News."}]
