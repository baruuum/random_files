I'm a nice guy. Now you're saying that other country's are doing just fine without Guns? Lol NO NO NO!!! Do you see what the hell is going on in Europe with the Muslim invasion or did you forget to Mention that part? The Europeans are telling us NOT to ever give up our GOD Giving Right of the 2nd Amendment. There homes are being invaded there women & children are being Raped & the FUKIN Government are sitting back & watching it all OH & they now have a Muslim PM. Something doesn't smell right wouldn't you agree? Just like I said they take your guns so when they come like they're doing now in Europe you won't be able to defend yourself. ...","commenter_a":"You gun loving Americans are so funny. I will bet all I have, that if one of you ever find yourself in a situation like the one this douche bag is referring to, which 99,9 to 100 % of you never will, you and your gun won't do anything but piss your pants. Guns would not have stopped this, nor any other terrorist attack, just like guns isn't stopping anything in your country, quite the opposite in fact. You won't see european people from Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels or any other high risk cities demand a right to carry guns, because we don't want to, because we know it don't work and because we are not stupid.

This solution gives the wrong message, that guns are okay, you just need to make them safer. But guns are not okay. But Americans will never understand this unfortunately. America was build on guns and blood. What do you expect. Don't come now with the reason it's the same with a knife. You can use a knife for different things, but it can also kill someone. A gun though has only one aim and it was made only for one reason and one purpose. To kill. And it's a very unfair way of killing too. I hate guns, I wish they all would disappear.","commenter_a":"This is a great idea if it can be refined to the point of consistent performance!","post_message":"Can a fingerprint save a life?
