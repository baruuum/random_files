To pretend they had no knowledge of it's origin is BS. They should be fined and held accountable. I lived across the street from this monument for two years and while the area does have its issues, there is no reason to bash Hartford. There is a multitude of beautiful and historical architecture to see in that area if you are willing to get out of your car. Many state and local residents have worked long and hard to have the Colt area designated as a National Park. This is a slap in the face to a city that is trying to restore some remnants of it's former glory. Take the tour - learn a little history and have an appreciation for some of the treasures in our own back yard.","post_message":"\"When I first saw it, it almost made you want to cry.\""},{"comment_id":"10153633611351337","commenter_b":"Joey Nicgorski Edward Contreras","commenter_a":"Thank god!","post_message":"POSSIBLE REUNION?

I pushed hard all weekend long to vote on defunding Planned Parenthood. My campaign sent out millions of emails mobilizing patriots like you to join this critical fight. It worked. I believe right now you are seeing the impact one man who's willing to stand for something can make in Washington, D.C. with the backing of millions of good folks like you. But now our job gets even tougher. Please call your U.S. Senators at (202) 224-3121 and insist they \"Stand with Rand\" and vote for my bill to defund Planned Parenthood.
