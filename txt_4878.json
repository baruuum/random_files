Labels are so 90s. I support Bernie because of his integrity, his consistency and his sincerity. I see none of those qualities in Hillary. I see the opposite in Hillary. I support Bernie because of his policies. Hillary uses too many weasel words when she talks about policy. She likes to leave the door open because she plans to make a hard right as soon as she's elected. She owes too many favors to the banks, corporations and wealthy investors who back her. They need a return on their investment and good ol' Hillary will no doubt deliver the goods.","commenter_a":"The media is dying to have Bush v. Clinton 2.0 so badly but I've never met anyone in person who thinks either of them would make a good president. It's a media manufactured dream match. Both of them would be bad for America but good for ratings. as long As I live I never want to hear the name Bush again and Clinton's got way too much baggage. Policy-wise Hillary is just a kinder face to the same neocon agenda that Bush would be peddling. Sanders is our best hope.
