They are illegals!! NOT undocumented.... In Oklahoma you have to prove you are here LEGALLY, not an illegal criminal to get an Oklahoma ID or DL. Sign up for a DL as an illegal and get deported.","commenter_a":"If Americans went to Mexico illegally, they would be thrown in jail, deported, if they're lucky, possibly shot and killed, but I can guarantee they wouldn't be given free medical, free schooling, welfare, jobs, driver's license, etc....all at the tax payer's expense.","post_message":"An Oklahoma City grassroots effort to get undocumented immigrants drivers licenses is gaining momentum."},{"comment_id":"999119110145234","commenter_b":"I like the term \"political whores\". Appropriate. They were all PAID millions of dollars by Monsanto to vote this way. (I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg.) We should throw them all out and start over.","commenter_a":"I'm very against genetically modified foods, but the fda is supposed to be a small little entity. They aren't supposed to tell me what to eat. You guys are cutting off your noses to spite your face, and until you are willing to look at both sides of the argument and find the truth, you might as well just keep eating it like the little sheep you are.","post_message":"Despite the fact that some polls show that up to 95 percent of the American people want foods that contain genetically modified organisms to be labeled, there are a lot of politicians that don't seem to agree.

I honestly don't think that America would have a problem with a Female President, I just don't think that America wants Hillary Clinton to be that First Female President. She's got a rough track record, a record that has a lot of corruption and lies written upon said track record, and the American people see that. She's done a lot of great things in her life, but alas, being President will not be one of them.","post_message":"It looks like Hillary Clinton is done with politics for good. Is that good or sad news to you?"},{"comment_id":"10153618006223721","commenter_b":"But it all depends on your reason to carry. Most women who would carry a knife in their bra wouldn't need it because they can normally defend themselves better than most blokes.","commenter_a":"One more place to put my knife! Sweet. Sometimes I like to carry a couple, one in the pocket, one on the necklace and now a surprise bobbie blade heck yes! Though this was certainly a man's idea as no woman would go \"lets put something sharp next to my breasts and have it not be an underwire.
