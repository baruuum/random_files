I do like VP Biden, and respect him, but it is obvious that the DNC establishment see Hillary as a loser now. Senator Sanders is the ONLY candidate who is fighting for ALL of WE are the 99%. The media and their Oligarch Masters are afraid of Bernie Sanders, which is why they have been ignoring him. Bernie is fighting for WE the 99% regardless of race, age, gender, sexual orientation or beliefs. He should be getting 99% of ALL votes including republicans, democrats and independents. Let's all vote for our own self interests for a CHANGE. FEEL THE BERN? Everyone had better or we are doomed.","commenter_a":"The Dem establishment can't be too pleased if Biden does decide to run.

Her girl, delivery was worse that the sound of a dentist drill and it was more emetic than aphrodisiac. The audience was truly stunned , as if they were witnessing the senile ego of a down and out prostitute consumed, devoured, by her own inflated ego turning tricks in the parking lot. Her exaggerated performance wreaked. It almost seemed cruel to not instantly cut to a commercial. It was truly wretched. Mr. Ed pissing on stage would have been a great improvement! And I sure that horse is dead!","post_message":"If you were left scratching your head, hereâ€™s a quick explanation."}]
