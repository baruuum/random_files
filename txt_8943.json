Trump is an answer to prayer for this once great nation and he just might be a temporary reprieve from the judgment that we so rightly deserve and which looms so ominously on the horizon. He is clearly fighting back against the forces that be that are doing everything in their power to bring about global governance, he will fight for us, I believe that...he knows most of these devils personally and knows more than we do about them, I am sure, and he wants a great nation to leave to his own grandchildren...and he is bold and determined enough to want a great legacy to leave to them as well...what better legacy than saving a nation from itself...I have had many people ask me how I, as a Christian woman, could ...","post_message":"‚ÄúOur borders are like Swiss cheese,‚Äù Donald Trump said at tonight's #GOPdebate. \"This is wall that‚Äôs going to work.

Federal crisis exercises have a strange historical tendency to suddenly coincide with very real crisis events. The elites are clearly preparing for something big. When the elites wage war on America, this is how they will do it: They will control public opinion, control the public, isolate population centers, decapitate leadership, and initiate fourth-generation warfare. Crisis is the best weapon the elites have at their disposal, and exercises like Jade Helm show that they may use it in the near term. The defense that defeats crisis is preparation ‚Äî preparation not just for yourself, but for others around you.
