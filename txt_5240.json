He also attacked the cops, that is clearly seen on video. White people who are drunk and high on drugs are beaten by the police when they resist arrest too... Please tell all the story of you are going to tell it. As for the Black Lives Matter movement goes, they just increase tension and stir things up. All Lives Matter, end of story. Where are the BLM protesters when two black kids are shot in their front yard in a gang-related shooting and there are no leads in the case? Nowhere. If a white police officer isn't involved, they don't care. They just want headlines, not community building. And that community is all of us, not just one ethnic group.","post_message":"Rodney King, an American taxi driver, was beaten by four LAPD officers after being caught speeding.
