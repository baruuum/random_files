The problem is not guns. It is hearts without G-o-d. It is homes without discipline. It is schools without p-r-a-y-e-r. It is courts without justice. It is Obama willful destruction of the economy and good jobs, families to flourish. It is Obama directive to not enforce gun laws, giving himself the perfect excuse to label guns as the problem.
