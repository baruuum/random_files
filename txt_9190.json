I said he can't run it, but he certainly doesn't have to give up ownership. Then tell me how the Clintons were able to run the Clinton Foundation when Billy was in office ? Yeah they found something in Benghazi. They found four dead Americans that pleaded for help. They found gross negligence and mishandling of top secret information on Lying Hillary's emails. Are you saying that's not true ? Name one significant contribution that Lying Hillary has done on her own besides being first lady and riding her husband's coattails a husband who she couldn't even keep happy so he found his entertainment elsewhere. Not to mention a husband that was impeached. She is filthy rich, she take huge donations from corporations, her Clinton Foundation is under investigation for taking money from known terrorists countries, she voted for the war we are in now. ...","commenter_a":"It is an abuse of tax payers dollars and highly unethical for obama to give Hillary a ride on Air Force One.
