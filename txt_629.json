If I had a dollar for every time I was pushed, grabbed or shoved. Campaign events are feeding frenzies, if you're a reporter covering a campaign event and you don't get pushed around a lot, literally, then you're not cut out for the job. It's par for the course! Thousands of people show up at campaign events and everyone is pushing and shoving to get a piece of the candidate and their staff has a duty to protect the candidate. I was in the White House in the Oval Office with the press pool one time and an aide or SS agent pushed me after I got too close to then Vice President Dick Cheney.

Because I'm American hispanic and I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, and his supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the \"Trump Strong\" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Strong Again!
